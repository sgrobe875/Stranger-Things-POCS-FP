Thanks
sweetheart
Of

Tom
Hm
I
really
hate
to
ask
this
but
do
you
think
one
of
the
other
girls
could
run
and
grab
lunch
today
Theyre
needed
at
their
desks
I
know
I
just
um
I
really
need
to
go
to
the

Ive
been
having
some
um
girl
problems
Oh
come
on
The
light
Lets
go
Look
I
just
I
just
dont
know
if
this
is
such
a
good
idea
anymore
Really
Because
I
feel
like
its
the
best
idea
Ive
had
all
summer
Look
all
Im
saying
is
what
harm
is
there
in
asking
The
harm
in
asking
is
that
Tom
will
say
no
We
ask
for
forgiveness
not
permission
And
if
this
storys
as
good
as
I
think
its
gonna
be
then
Tom
wont
care
In
fact
hell
thank
us
Or
the
old
lady
is
nuts
and
the
story
blows
up
in
our
face
and
Tom
fires
us
And
then
we
never
have
to
work
at
this
shithole
again
Go
oh
oh
Oh
oh
oh
So
get
up
and
go
If
youre
so
tired
of
moving
slow

Get
up
and
go

Nancy

briefly
on
the
phone
last
night
Were
from
The
Hawkins
Post
Oh

Oh

goodness
Oh
You

too
young
for

We

that
a
lot
Follow

Oh

its
lovely
Um
do
you
live
here
all
alone
Yes
Jack

now
ten
years
ago
Oh
um
Im
Im
so
sorry
Oh
dont
be
I
kinda
like
the
quiet
At
least
I
did
This
way
Its
right
over
there
You
see
those
little
teeth
marks
dont
ya
And
these
bags
um
youre
sure
they
were
full
before
Im
old
honey
not
senile
Bought
them
over
at
Blackburns
Supplies
just
last
Tuesday
Now
you
tell
me
why
would
rats
want
to
eat
a
poor
old
womans
fertilizer
Are
you
sure
they
did
Maybe
they
just
gnawed
the
bag
I
mean
eating
fertilizer
seems
Crazy
Believe
me
I
know
honey
But
Somethings
not
right
with
these
rats
What
does
that
mean
exactly
not
right
Rabies
my
guess
Thats
when
I
said
to
myself
Doris
you
gotta
call
the
paper
Because
if
those
diseased
rats
are
runnin
loose
the
people
they
oughta
know
Wouldnt
you
agree
Oh

Jim
Mayor
Kline
is
ready
for
you
Great
Thank
you
Jim
Thanks
for
coming
by
Im
not
doing
it
Larry
Calm
down
now
You
dont
even
know
what
I
want
You
dont
like
your
fan
club
you
want
me
to
shut
em
down
Sound
about
right
Whend
you
get
so
serious
Take
a
seat
My
fan
club
as
you
call
them
now
you
know
why
theyre
out
there
dont
ya
Theyre
not
actually
fans
They
lost
their
jobs
to
the
mall
and
blame
me
for
helping
make
that
happen
Now
you
go
ask
anyone
else
in
this
town
They
all
love
the
mall
Its
helped
our
economy
grow
brought
in
new
jobs
and
just
some
incredible
new
stores
Which
is
why
they
all
stopped
shopping
at
their
uh
momandpops
Now
thats
not
me
Jim
Mmhmm
Uhuh
Thats
just
uh
good
old
fashioned
American
capitalism
Well
Larry
I
think
that
theyre
just
exercising
their
good
old
fashioned
American
right
to
protest
I
agree
Yeah
If
If
they
had
a
permit
Now
correct
me
if
Im
wrong
here
Jim
but
uh
I
dont
believe
they
secured
a
permit
from
your
office
did
they
Not
that
Im
aware
of
Then
I
do
believe
its
within
my
right
to
get
rid
of
them
Larry
Im
not
a
politics
guy
but
I
think
if
you
force
those
people
out
of
here
without
provocation
I
dont
think
thats
a
good
look
for
your
reelection
campaign
You
know
whats
in
four
days
Jim
Independence
Day
Thats
right
And
Im
gonna
throw
this
town
the
biggest
bash
its
ever
seen
Fireworks
music
activities
you
name
it
Im
gonna
pull
out
all
the
stops
You
know
why
Cause
at
the
end
of
the
day
thats
all
the
voters
will
remember
But
I
cant
think
much
less
plan
with
all
that
racket
going
on
out
there
So
if
you
dont
mind
please
just
do
your
job
Flash
your
little
gold
badge
and
get
rid
of
them
So
what
do
you
think
Hey
whats
wrong
Too
many
people
Against
the
rules
Seriously
You
have
superpowers
Whats
the
worst
that
could
happen
So
what
should
we
do
first
Youve
never
been
shopping
before
have
you
Well
then
I
guess
were
just
gonna
have
to
try
everything
Ooh

He

Jim
Forced

land
You

protest
all
you

Henry
youve
just
gotta
go
through
the
proper
channels
first
Nothing
proper
about
what
that
man
did
to
us
To
our
town
Yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
Special
delivery
Ooh
yeah
That
the
right
one
Yeah
Yeah
Thats
a
lot
of
color
for
you
Chief
Its
cuttingedge
stuff
all
right
Its
cuttingedge
Ill
start
off
with
a
Scotch
you
can
make
that
a
double
Very
good
sir
And
I
think
well
have
a
bottle
of
red
as
well
Very
good
sir
And
hows
your
cheeanti
Our
Chianti
is
quite
good
Chianti
Mediumbodied
with
just
a
hint
of
cherry
Great
Women
love
cherries
huh
All
right
well
have
that
and
two
two
glasses
please
one
for
uh
me
and
one
for
the
lady
Ooh
Very
good
sir
And
what
is
this
again
This
is
a
solenoid
Its
a
coil
wrapped
around
a
metallic
core
and
when
electricity
passes
through
it
It
creates
an
electromagnetic
field
Exactamundo
Now
for
the
fun
part
Shall
we
Yeah
I
I
dont
see
anything
Nope
You
cant
see
it
but
its
there
I
assure
you
Our
very
own
ClarkeByers
Electromagnetic
Field
Pretty
neato
huh
Yeah
And
this
field
affects
any
charged
object
in
its
vicinity
Just
like
my
magnets
Just
like
your
magnets
Okay
why
is
nothing
happening
Oh
because
our
field
is
stable
But
if
we
reduce
the
current
How
The
magnetic
dipoles
tried
to
orient
according
to
the
field
but
No
no
no
I
mean
how
is
this
happening
at
my
house
You
want
my
honest
opinion
One
of
your
kiddos
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
bumped
into
the
fridge
and
knocked
the
suckers
loose
And
the
magnets
at
Melvalds
Apophenia
Apowhatowhah
Apophenia
Uh
Youre
seeing
patterns
that
arent
there
Coincidence
But
what
if
its
not
Well
Theoreticallyspeaking
I
suppose
some
large
version
of
this
AC
transformer
could
exist
A
machine
of
some
kind
A
machine
But
in
order
to
reach
your
house
and
downtown
gosh
that
would
take
billions
of
volts
of
electricity
and
cost
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
But
it
is
possible
We
cured
polio
in
Landed
on
the
moon
in
As
I
tell
my
students
once
you
open
up
that
curiosity
door
anything
is
possible
The
week
is
long
the
silver
cat
feeds
when
blue
meets
yellow
in
the
west
I
mean
it
just
it
just
cant
be
right
Its
right
Honestly
I
think
its
great
news
How
is
this
great
news
I
mean
so
much
for
being
American
heroes
Its
total
nonsense
Its
not
nonsense
Its
too
specific
Its
obviously
a
code
What
do
you
mean
a
code
Like
a
super
secret
spy
code
Thats
a
total
stretch
I
dont
know
is
it
Youre
buying
into
this
Listen
just
for
kicks
lets
entertain
the
possibility
that
it
is
a
secret
Russian
transmission
Whatd
you
think
they
were
gonna
say
Fire
the
warhead
at
noon
Exactly
And
my
translation
is
correct
I
know
that
for
sure
so
The
silver
cat
feeds
W
hy
would
anyone
talk
like
that
unless
theyre
trying
to
mask
the
meaning
of
their
message
Exactly
Why
would
anyone
mask
the
true
meaning
of
their
message
unless
the
message
was
somehow
sensitive
Exactly
So
I
guess
that
confirms
your
suspicion
Evil
Russians
I
cant
believe
Im
about
to
agree
with
this
strange
child
but
yeah
totally
evil
Russians
So
how
do
we
crack
it
Well
I
guess
we
translate
the
rest
and
hopefully
a
pattern
emerges
A
pattern
Right
like
maybe
silver
cat
is
a
meeting
place
Or
a
person
Or
a
weapon
Its
probably
gonna
take
a
super
genius
to
crack
it
but
Wheres
Steve
Hey
Steve
What
are
you
doing
Uh
its
a
quarter
I
need
Do
you
have
a
quarter
Sure

ride
Quarter
You

shut
up
and
listen
Holy
shit
The
music
The
music
I
dont
understand
Its
the
exact
same
song
on
the
recording
Maybe
they
have
horses
like
this
in
Russia
Indiana
Flyer
I
dont
I
dont
think
so
This
code
it
didnt
come
from
Russia
It
came
from
here
Would
you
like
to
order
your
entrée
sir
You
know
what
Enzo
My
name

not

I
just
lost
my
appetite

new

What

A
tribe

Is

Michael
Tell

to
the
villagers
crying
for
your
help
the
children
so
frightened
they
cannot
sleep
Are
you
truly
going
to
let
them
perish
Or

you
going
to
come
to
their
rescue
and
become
the
heroes
you
were
always
meant
to
be
Uh
Can
I
at

take
a
shower

Oh

Hopper
Are

Oh
Look

We

I

stood
up
like
that
since
Alice
Gilbert
in
the
th
grade
What
are
you
doing
Joyce
Hello
Just
watch
Okay
youre
freaking
me
out
You
slipped
on
this
remember
Yeah
Yeah
it
fell
in
the
night
It
lost
its
magnetism
Oh
did
it
And
the
same
exact
thing
happened
at
my
house
the
day
before
Wow
And
I
thought
Okay
thats
weird
Right
Why
are
all
these
magnets
suddenly
losing
their
magnetism
Uhhuh
So
I
went
and
saw
Scott
Scott
Whos
Scott
Scott
Clarke
Your
childs
science
teacher
Hes
pretty
brilliant
actually
And
I
asked
him
How
is
this
happening
And
he
built
this
magnetic
field
using
an
AC
transformer
and
plugging
it
into
a
solenoid
And
And
with
that
solenoid
which
basically
Slow
down
slow
down
I
just
want
to
get
this
exactly
right
okay
You
stand
me
up
no
phone
call
no
apology
because
you
had
to
go
to
Scott
Clarkes
house
Yeah
Youve
outdone
yourself
Joyce
You
really
have
No
youve
outdone
yourself
Oh
come
on
Hop
youre
not
even
listening
to
me
Scott
was
able
to
demagnetize
some
of
the
magnets
and
he
thinks
I
dont
care
what
Scott
thinks
He
thinks
that
a
largescale
magnetic
field
could
be
built
using
some
sort
of
machine
or
or
experimental
technology
Hes
brilliant
isnt
he
Hes
really
brilliant
Is
he
single
too
What
if
its
them
To
build
a
machine
like
this
you
need
resources
You
need
scientists
you
need
funding
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
Joyce
It
cant
just
be
a
coincidence
Hopper
It
has
to
be
them
Joyce
stop
It
has
to
be
the
lab
It
is
impossible
Well
then
prove
it
to
me
Prove
it
Yeah
take
me
back
there
To
the
lab
Yeah
I
wanna
go
back
Because
some
magnets
fell
off
your
fridge
Yes

You

scared
I

scared

now
youre
inventing
things
Youre
inventing
things
to

worked
up
about
so
that
you
can
push
me

Because
God
forbid
any
of

Jack
Flash

the
Devils
only
friend
Oh

I
watched
him
on
the
stage
My
hands
were
clenched
In
fists
of
rage
No
angel
born
in
Hell
Could
break
that
Satans
spell
And
as
the
flames
climbed
high
Into
the
night
To
light
the
sacrificial
rite
I
saw
Satan
laughing
with
delight
The
day
the
music
died
He
was
singin
Bye
bye
Miss
American
Pie
Drove
my
Chevy

Them

like

a
murderer
because

wouldve
totally
sucked
Who

that
See
this
is
why
you
cant
just
hang
out
with
Mike
all
the
time
This
is
Wonder
Woman
AKA
Princess
Diana
Shes
from
Paradise
Island

hidden
island
where

are
only
women
Amazon
warriors

How

out
A
while
Youve
been
drifting
in
and
out
Yeah

how
did
I
get
here
Slowly
Whats
the
last
thing
you

Some
thug
attacked
me
Hey

No
Im

No
youre
not

Hop
Im
fine
Im
fine
Um
Where

my
clothes
Uh
Uh
They

soaked
I
mean
did
you
recognize
him
Who
The
thug
Well
I
didnt
get
a
good
look
Well
I
mean
hes
gotta
be
government
right
Yeah
but
if
hes
government
whats
he
doing
slinking
around
WWhy
is
he
running
You
know
why
didnt
we
find
anything
down
there
Lets
ask
him
What
is
that
His
license
plate
What
are
the
dashes
Well
theyre
blanks
There
was
I
think
it
was
either
an
H
or
a
P
with
the
part
rubbed
off
And
there
was
definitely
a
Y
For
sure
And
that
I
think
was
a
B
but
it
couldve
been
an
eight
And
that
Wait
I
think
you
should
stick
to
sales
Cant
you
run
a
search
or
something
I
just
think
you
have
to
lower
your
expectations
I
mean
this
is
a
state
government
agency
Gonna
take
weeks
before
they
find
a
match
Weeks
If
were
lucky
And
I
mean
what
are
the
odds
that
this
guy
registers
a
car
in
his
own
name
It
wasnt
a
car
Uh
what
are
you
wearing
What
do
you

Whatevers

Dunno

with
it
but
I
just
thought
you
should
know
Nancy
Jonathan
Ive
worked
at
this
paper
for
twentyfive
years
Twentyfive
years
Now
were
a
smalltown
paper
but
we
have
something
the
big
papers
dont
have
trust
The
trust
of
our
community
Tom
if
you
just
Do
you
know
how
I
built
that
trust
By
placing
my
faith
in
something
the
two
of
you
dont
seem
to
value
a
whole
lot
facts
Facts
So
while
were
here
lets
go
over
the
facts
Fact
one
you
disobeyed
a
direct
order
to
stop
pursuing
this
story
Two
you
falsely
identified
yourselves
as
reporters
repeatedly
lying
to
an
elderly
woman
Three
you
broke
into
her
home
committing
trespass
Four
she
almost
died
en
route
to
the
hospital
She
wouldve
died
if
we
hadnt
shown
up
Whatever
disease
that
rat
had
clearly
passed
to
her
Five
Mrs
Driscoll
is
a
paranoid
schizophrenic
You
didnt
know
that
did
you
Now
diseasecarrying
rats
The
second
coming
of
the
plague
Does
this
sound
credible
to
you
or
perhaps
does
this
sound
more
like
the
delusions
of
a
very
sick
old
lady
I
didnt
know
that
Her
familys
furious
So
furious
in
fact
theyve
threatened
litigation
Litigation
Thats
crazy
For
once
we
agree
This
is
crazy
In
fact
in
my
entire
professional
career
Ive
never
dealt
with
anything
quite
like
it
But
hopefully
hopefully
youve
learned
something
valuable
here
Youve
learned
how
in
the
workplace
in
the
real
world
there
are
consequences
to
your
actions
Which
brings
me
to
my
sixth
and
final
fact
Youre
fired
Both
of
you
I
didnt
think
it
was
anything
at
first
I
mean
I
think
I
just
didnt
want
to
believe
it
The
first
time
I
felt
it
was
at
Day
of
the
Dead
Power
went
out
that
night
too
And
then
I
felt
it
again
at
the
field
near
the
Nelson
farm
the
next
day
Then
again
yesterday
outside
Castle
Byers
Will
What
does
it
feel
like
Its
almost
like
You
know
when
you
drop
on
a
roller
coaster
Sure
Yeah
No
Its
like
everything
inside
your
body
is
just
sinking
all
at
once
but
this
is
worse
Your
body
it
goes
cold
and
and
you
cant
breathe
Ive
felt
it
before
whenever
he
was
close
Whenever
who
was
close
The
Mind
Flayer
Go
away
Go
away
I
closed
the
gate
I
know
but
what
if
he
never
left
What
if
we
locked
him
out
here
with
us
This
is
him
All
of
him
But
that
day
on
the
field
a
part
of
him
attached
itself
to
me
My
mom
got
it
out
of
me
Get
the
hell
out
of
my
son
And
Eleven
closed
the
gate
But
the
part
that
was
still
in
me
what
if
its
still
in
our
world
In
Hawkins
I
dont
understand
The
Demodogs
died
when
El
closed
the
gate
If
the
brain
dies
the
body
dies
We
cant
take
any
chances
We
need
to
assume
the
worst
The
Mind
Flayers
back
Yeah
And
if
he
is
hed
want
to
attach
himself
to
someone
again
A
new
me
A
new
host
How
can
you
tell
if
someone
is
a
host
Hey
is
he
in
Yes
hes
busy
at
the
moment
but
Great
Excuse
me

the
County
Recorders
Office
Starcourt
Mall
The
complete
blueprints
Not
bad
So
this
is
us
Scoops
and
this
is
where
we
want
to
get
I
mean
I
dont
really
see
a
way
in
Theres
not
if
youre
talking
exclusively
about
doors
Air
ducts
Exactly
Turns
out
this
secret
room
needs
air
just
like
any
old
room
And
these
air
ducts
lead
all
the
way
here
Flashlight
Thank

Push

Youre

Come

Im

Just

One

Shit

One
more

Ahoy
sailors
All

Ahoy
Come

Get
over
here
and
serve
me
some
samples
I
dont

He
looks
pretty
normal
to
me
Normal
How
many
times
have
you
seen
him
with
a
shirt
on
I
mean
its
a
little
weird
More
than
a
little
He
was
in
a
tub
with
ice
The
Mind
Flayer
likes
it
cold
Plus
everything
else
But
hes
lounging
at
the
pool
which
is
like
the
least
Mind
Flayer
thing
ever
Not
necessarily
The
Mind
Flayer
likes
to
hide
He
only
used
me
when
he
needed
me
Its
like
like
youre
dormant
And
then
when
he
needs
you
youre
activated
Okay
so
we
just
wait
until
he
gets
activated
No
What
if
he
hurts
someone
Or
kills
someone
We
cant
take
that
chance
We
need
to
find
out
if
hes
the
host
Where
are
you
going
I
have
an
idea
Boys
only
Seriously
Just
trust
me
on
this
one
Okay
so
we
wait
until
the
pool
closes
until
everyone
leaves
and
we
somehow
get
him
to
come
from
here
and
get
him
into
here
Hey
shut
the
door
Hey
come
on
kid
shut
it
I
think
I
just
threw
up
in
my
mouth
And
look
the
controls
are
right
here
Its
perfect
Will
it
get
hot
enough
degrees
We
just
have
to
figure
out
how
to
get
him
in
here
Then
we
lock
him
in
Heat
him
up
No
matter
what
happens
well
know
Well
know
for
sure
Hmm
Yeah
I
dont
know
You
dont
know
if
you
can
fit
Oh
I
can
fit
I
just
dont
know
if
I
want
to
Are
you
claustrophobic
I
dont
have
phobias
Okay
well
whats
the
problem
The
problem
is
I
still
havent
heard
whats
in
this
for
Erica
More
fudge
please
Go
on
All
right
You
see
this
This
is
the
route
youre
gonna
take
Then
we
just
wait
till
the
last
delivery
goes
out
tonight
Then
you
knock
out
the
grate
jump
down
open
the
door
Then
you
find
out
whats
in
those
boxes
Exactly
Mmhmm
And

say
this
guard
is
armed
Yes
but
he
wont
be
there
And
booby
traps
Booby
traps
Lasers
spikes
in
the
wall
What
You
know
what
this
halfbaked
plan
of
yours
sounds
like
to
me
Child
endangerment
Well
be
in
radio
contact
with
you
the
whole
time
Ah
ah
ah
Child
endangerment
Erica
Hi
Uh
We
think
these
Russians
want
to
do
harm
to
our
country
Great
harm
Dont
you
love
your
country
You
cant
spell
America
without
Erica
Uh
yeah
yeah
Oddly
thats
uh
totally
true
So
so
dont
do
this
for
us
Do
it
for
your
country
Do
it
for
your
fellow
man
Do
this
for
America
Erica
Ooh
I
just
got
the
chills
Oh
yeah
from
this
float
not
your
speech
Know
what
I
love
most
about
this
country
Capitalism
Do
you
know
what
capitalism
is
Yeah
Yeah
It
means
this
is
a
free
market
system
Which
means
people
get
paid
for
their
services
depending
on
how
valuable
their
contributions
are
And
it
seems
to
me
my
ability
to
fit
into
that
little
vent
is
very
very
valuable
to
you
all
So
you
want
my
help
This
USS
Butterscotch
better
be
the
first
of
many
And
Im
talking
free
ice
cream
for
life
Wow
I
love
the
place
Lar
Hey
you
shoot
that
fella
yourself
Thats
Thats
not
real
No
shit
All
right
so
what
exactly
are
we
looking
at
Land
deeds
transfers
of
property
So
your
buddies
at
Starcourt
they
suddenly
start
buying
up
all
this
property
They
tell
you
why
I
already
told
you
they
dont
tell
me
anything
Theyre
just
using
you
I
get
it
What
I
dont
get
is
why
you
have
a
bunch
of
land
deeds
in
a
safe
in
your
bedroom
These
people
Jim
theyre
bad
news
So
what
this
is
blackmail
Protection
Protection
Hold
on
a
second
Hey
what
is
it
Hess
Farm
Henrys
place
Bullocks
Look
theyre
all
here
Theyre
all
in
Southeast
Hawkins
right
near
Jordan
Lake
And
what
else
is
near
Jordan
Lake
The
power
plant
Four
nights
ago
there
was
a
huge
power
outage
and
the
next
day
Your
magnets
fell
Yeah
I
mean
Scott
says
that
this
machine
would
take
a
massive
amount
of
power
to
run
Yeah
So
what
if
this
machine
that
weve
been
talking
about
really
does
exist
and
the
reason
that
we
didnt
find
it
at
the
lab
is
because
it
isnt
at
the
lab
its
at
one
of
these
properties
Um
I
want
you
to
forget
about
sales
I
want
you
to
come
work
for
me
at
the
Hawkins
PD
And
have
to
look
at
your
face
every
day
I
dont
think
so
Larry
Hey
Hey
where
do
you
think
youre
going
pal
Nancy
Nance
Maybe
Jonathans
right
To
be
honest
I
wasnt
thinking
about
him
I
wasnt
thinking
about
anyone
really
I
just
I
wanted
to
be
right
I
wanted
to
be
right
so
badly
And
were
you
I
thought
so
But
maybe
I
just
dont
want
to
admit
that
Im
wrong
because
if
Im
wrong
then
Youre
what
everyone
thinks
you
are
Just
a
kid
who
has
no
idea
what
shes
doing
Its
not
easy
out
there
Nance
I
know
People
are
always
saying
you
cant
That
you
shouldnt
That
youre
not
smart
enough
not
good
enough
This
world
it
it
beats
you
up
again
and
again
until
eventually
I
Most
people
they
just
they
just
stop
trying
But
youre
not
like
that
Youre
a
fighter
You
always
have
been
I
honestly
dont
know
where
you
get
it
from
Dad
I
think
you
were
swapped
in
the
hospital
to
tell
you
the
truth
No
I
get
it
from
you
Mom
I
get
it
from
you
Well
wherever
you
get
it
from
Im
proud
of
you
Proud
of
me
for
getting
fired
That
you
stood
up
for
yourself
That
you
stood
up
to
those
shitheads
Mom
Yes
those
shitheads
And
if
you
believe
in
this
story
Look
at
me
Nancy
Finish
it
Then
go
sell
it
to
The
Indianapolis
Star
or
whatever
and
I
mean
can
you
imagine
their
faces
when
they
read
a
story
about
their
own
town
in
a
big
paper
like
that
That
would
be
pretty
amazing
So
why
not
Why

us
Up
to
us
to
do
what
exactly
Find
Billy

stop

Okay

thats
a
really
nice
sentiment
but
even
if
El
could
find
him
again
and
thats
a
pretty
big
if
then
what
We
burn
the
shit
out
of
him
and
make
sure
he
doesnt
escape
this
time
Okay

Then

the
problem
We
dont
We
dont

We

the
Mind
Flayer
out
of
Will
before

came
right
back
We
dont
just
have
to
stop
Billy
we
have
to
stop
the
Mind
Flayer
How
in
the
hell
do
we
do
that
I
dont
know
Maybe
El

What
are
they
still
doing
in
there
I
dont
know
Girls

like
hanging
out
in
bathrooms
Why
I
mean
I
dont
know
Theyre
conspiring
against
me
Thats
what
youre
concerned
about

Its
not
my
main
concern
Its
just
a
subconcern
I
thought
it
was
already
over
Its
not
over
okay
Were
just
taking
a
break
She
said
she
dumped
your
ass
That

Code

copy
This
is
a
code
red
I
repeat
a
code
red
This
is
a
code
red
I
repeat
a
code
red
Does
anyone
copy
We
are
innocent
children
and
we
are
trapped
under
Starcourt
Mall
The
Red
Army
has
infiltrated
Hawkins
and
if
we
are
found
they
will
torture
and
kill
us
Hey
Gotta
take
it
easy
on
that
thing
Gonna
drain
the
battery
The
mall
just
opened
So
So
someone
could
be
in
range
What
do
you
think
Petey
the
Mall
Cop
is
gonna
rappel
down
here
and
save
the
day
All

why
are
you
such
a
cranky
pants
after

to
spend
the
night
with
Robin
Shh
Jesus
Christ
Will
you
just
give
up
on
your
creepy
dream
already
I
heard
you
guys
talking
all
night
We
were
trying
to
figure
out
a
way
to
open
up
the
door
while
you
children
were
sleeping
After
eight
hours
were
still
exactly
nowhere
which
is
you
know
probably
just
a
little
bit
of
the
reason
why
Im
feeling
just
a
tad
cranky
What
are
you
doing
What
does
it
look
like
Im
doing
Im
taking
a
leak
Look

Look

Can
you
redirect
your
stream
please
Ugh
Hey
hey
Be
careful
careful
careful
We
dont
even
know
what
that
is
Exactly
It
could
be
useful
Useful
how
We
can
survive
down
here
a
long
time
without
food
but
if
the
human
body
doesnt
get
water
it
will
die
I
hate
to
break
it
to
you
but
this
is
not
water
No
but
its
a
liquid
and
if
it
comes
down
to
me
drinking
that
shit
or
dying
of
thirst
I
drink
Weve
got
company
You
smell
that
What
Piss

Todd
Todd
Yeah
Todd
Todd
Todd
listen
to
me
That
man
in
there
I
know
he
doesnt
look

but
he
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
the
world
Hes
uh
murdered
many
children
What
Yeah
hes
a
true
psychopath
I
tracked
him
over
two
state
lines
Hey
whats
going
on
Ah
Detective
Byers
Uh
this
is
Todd
Hes
agreed
to
lend
us
his
vehicle
to
transport
our
dangerous
criminal
Oh

very
dangerous
uh
forger
er
Yeah
Uh
child
murderer
Child
murderer
We

Hey
how

I
get

You
just
call
the
station
What
station
Ooh
I
like
the
sound
of
that
Todd
Hey
what
station
Youre
doing
the
right
thing
Hey
what
the
Hey
Dude
I
mean
you
have
to
admit
as
a
feat
of
engineering
alone
this
is
impressive
What
are
you
talking
about
Its
a
total
fire
hazard
Theres
no
stairs
theres
no
exit
theres
just
an
elevator
that
drops
you
halfway
to
hell
Theyre
Commies
You
dont
pay
people
they
cut
corners
To
be
fair
to
our
Russian
comrades
I
dont
think
this
tunnel
was
designed
for
walking
Think
about
it
they
developed
the
perfect
system
for
transporting
that
cargo
It
all
comes
into
the
mall
like
any
old
delivery
And
then
they
load
it
up
onto
those
trucks
and
nobodys
the
wiser
You
think
they
built
this
whole
mall
so
they
could
transport
that
green
poison
I
very
seriously
doubt
its
something
as
boring
as
poison
Its
gotta
be
much
more
valuable
like
promethium
or
something
What
the
hell
is
promethium
Its
what
Victor
Stones
dad
used
to
make
Cyborgs
bionic
and
cybernetic
components
Youre
all
so
nerdy
it
makes
me
physically
ill
No
no
no
No
dont
lump
me
in
with
them
Im
not
a
nerd
all
right
Why
so
sensitive
Harrington
Afraid
of
losing
cool
points
to
a
tenyearold
child
No
Im
just
saying
I
dont
know
jack
shit
about
Prometheus
Promethium
Prometheus
is
a
Greek
mythological
figure
but
whatever
All
Im
saying
is
its
probably
being
used
to
make
something
Or
power
something
Like
a
nuclear
weapon
Totally
Walking
towards
a
nuclear
weapon
Thats
great
Thatd
be
great
But
if
theyre
building
something
why
here
I
mean
Hawkins
Seriously
Of
all
places
At
the
very
best
were
a
toilet
stop
on
your
way
to
Disneyland
but
maybe
thats
it
Maybe
its
our
very
You
think
the
Russians
know
About
They
could
So
its
connected
Maybe
How
I
dont
know
but
its
Possible
Im
sorry
is
there
something
youd
like
to
share
with
the
class
Walkie
A
trip
to
China
sounds
nice
If
you
tread
lightly
Its
the
code
Wherever
that
broadcast
is
coming
from
Its
close
And
if
theres
one
thing
we
know
about
that
signal
It
can
reach
the
surface
Lets
go
Tom
Heather
Jesus
its
freezing
Do
you
guys
smell
that
Oh
Oh
God
More
chemicals
You
think
theyre
guzzling
this
shit
Yeah
either
that
or
they
just
went
on
a
hell
of
a
cleaning
spree
But
last
year
Will
didnt
eat
chemicals
Did
you
No
This

new
Mr

Posit

Mrs
Driscoll
She
kept
saying
I
have
to
go
back
What
if
the
flaying
its
taking
place
somewhere
else
There
must
be
a
place
where
all
this
started
right
A
source
Somewhere
he
didnt
want
me
to
see
If
we
can
find
the
source
then
maybe
we
can
stop
him
Or
at
least
stop
it
from
spreading
or
doing
whatever
the
hell
hes
doing
with
those
chemicals
How
do
we
find
it
Mrs
Driscoll
If
she
wants
to
go
back

badly

dont

how
many
miles
in
a
hundred
degree
heat
stole
a
car
all
while
being
chased
by
this
gigantic
psychopath
all
so
we

Because

youre
the
closest
person

Very

Please
Im
sorry
I
I

a
bad
temper
Im

You

one
day
to
find
this
man
for
me
Nod
if
you
understand
Two
Whoppers
extra
ketchup
large
fry
pack
of
Marlboro
Reds
and
one
extralarge
Slurpee
Burger
King
is
nowhere
near
the
Eleven
by
the
way
Never
said
it
was
Lets
try
this
again
Joyce
Alexei
the
generators
what
are
they
powering
And
tell
him
that
we
know
it
is
not
the
Starcourt
Mall
so
he
can
stop
selling
us
that
crap
Those
generators
you
were
working
on
what
are
you
powering
We
know
its
not
the
mall
This
tastes
like
shit
strawberry
Whatd
he
say
He
says
Its
strawberry
Im
sorry
His
Slurpee
He
says
its
strawberry
So
what
Hop
he
did
ask
for
cherry
I
mean
Well
they
didnt
have
cherry
They
didnt
have
it
And
it
doesnt
matter
because
it
all
tastes
the
same
okay
It
is
sugar
on
ice
You
tell
him
that
Tell
him
what
You
tell
him
that
it
all
tastes
the
goddamn
same
Its
all
the
same
Sugar
on
ice
No
difference
Tell
that
stupid
man
it
is
not
the
same
in
the
slightest
and
I
would
like
the
cherry
I
requested
He
respectfully
disagrees
Its
not
the
same
at
all
and
he
would
like
cherry
Oh
yeah
You
tell
him
he
can
forget
it
He
says
forget
it
No
cherry
No
cherry
no
deal
He
says
No
cherry
no
deal
Yeah
Hm
Mm
Oh
shit
No
Hop
Wait
wait
wait
wait
wait
Im
not
gonna
hurt
him
What
are
you
doing
Come
on
Come
on
Im
just
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
get
his
own
damn
cherry
Slurpee
Jim
that
man
is
an
enemy
of
the
state
Yeah
whos
been
jerking
us
around
for
a
full
day
I
get
him
his
cherry
Slurpee
then
what
He
wants
a
helicopter
to
charter
him
to
his
own
private
island
I
have
dealt
with
assholes
like
this
my
entire
life
Yesterday
in
the
woods
he
couldve
escaped
but
he
didnt
He
stuck
with
us
Why
do
you
think
that
is
Its
because
hes
scared
Hes
scared
Not
of
us
of
them
Hes
scared
of
that
sevenfoottall
Russian
freak
who
couldve
killed
him
just
as
easily
as
us
Smirnoff
knows
that
if
he
runs
back
to
his
comrades
without
a
scratch
on
him
theyre
gonna
think
that
he
spilled
his
guts
So
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
we
are
the
best
chance
hes
got
Ooh
I
give
him
seconds
before
he
comes
knocking
on
that
door
right
back
into
our
arms
with
a
new
sense
of
humility
I
dont
wanna
take
it
anymore
Jim
Uh
I
uh
believe
he
has
started
the
car
Hopper
You
know
testing
us
Hes
just
calling
my
bluff
Cause
I
work
so
hard
To
make
it
every
day
Wooooh
I
believe
he
is
now
driving
away
Jim
Jim
move
Joyce
Joyce
Move
move
move
Yeah
Oohooh
huh
Yeah
And
its
hard
to
say
Just
how
some
things
never
change
And
its
hard
to
find
Any
strength
to
draw
the
line
Ooh
Im
just
burning
Doin
the
neutron
dance
Im
just
burning
Doin
the
neutron
dance
I
know
theres
a
pot
of
gold
for
me
All
Ive
got
to
do
is
just
believe
Doin
the
neutron
dance
And
Im
just
burning
Im
sorry
what
did
he
say
He
says
he
likes
strawberry
too
Im
just
burning
In
my
feet
Doin
the
neutron
dance
woohoo
So
when
we
set
fire
to
the
hub
we
drew
the
Demodogs
away
so
El
could
close
the
gate
But
now
for
some
insane
reason
the
Russians
appear
to
be
trying
to
reopen
it
which
just
destroys
everything
we
risked
our
lives
for
By
we
youre
including
Lucas
Yes
of
course
So
all
that
shit
you
told
me
Lucas
was
there
Yeah
My
brother
Lucas
Charles
Sinclair
Yes
I
dont
believe
you
Wait
so
you
believe
everything
about
El
and
the
gate
and
the
Demodogs
and
the
Mind
Flayer
but
you
question
your
brothers
involvement
Thats
correct
Makes
total
sense
Um
you
need
help
with
that
No
Well
I
mean
its
taking
a
while
so
Yeah
no
shit
Sherlock
All
right
so
if
we
dont
find
a
more
efficient
method
to
stop
these
fans
were
never
gonna
find
help
and
your
ice
cream
buddies
are
screwed
Yeah
with
that
attitude
they
are
Jeezus
Im
just
being
realistic
I
mean
weve
made
it
about
pointthree
miles
in
nine
hours
Then
we
had
to
walk
three
hours
down
that
tunnel
so
Id
estimate
ten
miles
back
to
the
elevator
which
should
take
us
approximately
twelveandahalf
days
Did
you
just
do
all
of
that
in
your
head
Im
good
with
numbers
Holy
shit
Youre
a
nerd
Come
again
You
are
a
nerd
Okay
you
better
take
that
back
nerd
Cant
put
the
truth
back
in
the
box
But
its
not
the
truth
Lets
examine
the
facts
shall
we
Fact
one
youre
a
math
whiz
apparently
That
was
a
pretty
straightforward
equation
Fact
number
two
youre
a
political
junkie
Just
because
I
dont
agree
with
Communism
as
an
ideology
Fact
number
three
you
love
My
Little
Pony
And
what
does
My
Little
Pony
have
to
do
with
this
Ah
lets
recall
the
ponies
latest
adventure
shall
we
The
evil
centaur
team
and
Tirek
turns
Applejack
into
a
dragon
at
Midnight
Castle
and
then
Megan
and
the
other
ponies
have
to
use
Moochicks
magic
to
defeat
his
rainbow
of
darkness
saving
them
from
a
lifetime
of
enslavement
All
the
pink
in
the
world
cant
disguise
the
irrefutable
fact
that
centaurs
and
castles
and
dragons
and
magic
are
all
standard
nerd
tropes
Ergo
My
Little
Pony
is
nerdy
Ergo
you
Erica
are
a
nerd
And
how
do
you
know
so
much
about
My
Little
Pony
Because
Im
a
nerd
Lets
go
nerd
You
That
one
stung
Who

you
work
for
For

millionth
time

Scoops
Ahoy
Scoops
Ahoy
What

hell
Look
at
my
outfit
Look

my
outfit
You

uniform
How
did
you
get
in
I
already
told
you
I
told
you
before
My
delivery
didnt
come
and
my
friends
and
I
we
thought
that
it
was
left
at
the
loading
dock
so
we
went
in
the
room
and
then
it
turned
into
an
elevator
and
then
and
then
we
dropped
and
then
next
thing
we
know
I
open
my
eyes
and
were
in
this
wonderful
facility
But
I
swear
to
God
nobody
knows
about
us
nobody
saw
us
You
could
just
let
us
go
all
right
And
Im
not
gonna
tell
anybody
about
this
okay
Shit
happens
life
goes
on
And
uh
ice
ice
cream
Ice
cream

what
ice
cream

Everybody

dont
know
if
you
have
Russian
ice
cream
or
if
thats
considered
gelato
I
dont
know
whats
what
but
whatever
you
guys
want
seriously
USS
Butterscotch
I
mean
you
gotta
try
it
It
is
out
of
this
world
Im
telling
ya
I
like
this
guy
USS
Butterscotch
Who
do
you
work
for
Oh
come
on
No
no
No
seriously
Get
your
hands
off
me
Hey
Steve
Steve
Steve
Steve
What
did
you
do
to
him
What
did
you
do
Put
them
in
the
chairs
Dont
touch
me
Steve
Steve
wake
up
Steve
What
did
you
do
Dont
touch
him
Steve
Steve
can
you
hear
me
I
think
your
friend
need
a
doctor
Good
thing
we
have
the
very
best
You
are
going
to
regret
that
little
bitch
Bastards
Let
us
outta
here
Bastards
Let
us
out
Let
us
out
It
cant
be
good
for
her
to
be
in
there
for
this
long
Mike
you
need
to
relax
What
if
she
gets
brain
damage
or
something
Oh
shit
Is
that
like
a
real
thing
No
its
not
He
made
it
up
Mike
doesnt
know
what
hes
talking
about
Oh
and
you
do
No
I
Yes
from
The
Hawkins
Post
I
I
called
a
couple
days
ago
about
the
Yes
yes
um
I
was
just
following
up
to
see
if
anything
else
had
gone
missing
or
if
Okay
Um
sorry
to
bother
Whos
next
There
is
no
next
Unless
you
want
to
start
calling
random
peoples
homes
It
doesnt
make
sense
What
part
of
any
of
this
makes
sense
Theres
a
pattern
okay
A
consistency
to
their
behavior
Theyve
been
feeding
on
these
chemicals
since
this
started
and
and
what
they
just
stop
out
of
the
blue
Maybe
they
have
all
the
chemicals
they
need
Maybe
theyve
all
turned
into
those
things
But
what
about
the
source
I
mean
did
the
Mind
Flayer
just
suddenly
stop
infecting
people
And
even
if
the
flayed
are
monsters
now
why
cant
El
find
them
Okay
can
you
guys
settle
an
argument
for
us
Who
do
you
think
should
decide
Els
limits
Mike
or
Eleven
The
way
that
you
frame
that
is
such
bullshit
Its
not
bullshit
Mike
This
is
your
whole
problem
And
its
also
precisely
the
reason
why
she
dumped
your
ass
El
dumped
you
Yeah
because
she
is
conspiring
against
me
Shes
corrupting
her
No
enlightening
her
The
fact
is
shes
not
yours
Shes
her
own
person
fully
capable
of
making
her
own
decisions
Shes
risking
her
life
for
no
reason
For
no
reason
Mike
the
flayed
are
out
there
doing
God
knows
what
Killing
flaying
Transforming
into
monsters
And
Els
not
stupid
She
knows
her
abilities
better
than
any
of
us
Exactly
thank
you
And
she
is
her
own
person
Exactly
With
her
own
free
will
Exactly
El
has
saved
the
world
twice
and
Mike
still
doesnt
trust
her
You
wanna
talk
about
trust
really
After
you
made
Eleven
spy
on
us
Wait
what
Oh
she
didnt
tell
you
this
No
Your
girlfriend
used
Els
powers
to
spy
on
us
No

I

make
her
It
was
her
idea
And
why
are
we
even
talking
about
this
seriously
Yeah
who
cares
I
care
Yeah
I
guess
girlfriends
dont
lie

We
were
just
joking
around
Wouldnt
itve
been
so
funny
if
I
was
taking
a
massive
shit
or
something
You
werent
But
what
if
I
was
Then
gross
Seriously
Mike
Im
just
trying
to
demonstrate
how
careless
Max
is
with
Elevens
powers
In
fact
how
careless
all
of
you
are
Youre
treating
her
like
some
kind
of
machine
when
shes
not
a
machine
and
I
dont
want
her
to
die
looking
for
the
flayed
when
theyve
obviously
vanished
off
the
face
of
the
Earth
So
can
we
please
just
come
up
with
a
new
plan
because
I
love
her
and
I
cant
lose
her
again
Whats
going
on
Nothing
Nothing
Just
a
family
discussion
Oh
I
found
him
Found
who
He
calls
it
the
key
and
this
key
emits
a
great
energy
It
requires
much
strength
power
Those
houses
like
the
one
you
found
theyre
located
near
uh
transformers
Theyre
stealing
from
your
towns
power
grid
Why
build
this
key
here
Why
are
they
not
doing
this
in
their
own
backyard
What
are
they
trying
to
do
blow
us
to
smithereens
There
were
many
of
these
uh
keys
before
in
Russia
but
they
turned
out
wrong
They
had
to
come
to
where
the
where
the
uh
Where
the
what
I
dont
understand
what
hes
saying
I
thought
you
were
fluent
Oh
Im
sorry
Are
my
free
translation
services
not
good
enough
for
you
Because
you
can
just
go
ahead
and
file
your
complaint
right
up
my
ass
What
is
Smirnoff
doing
Hes
showing
me
Oh
okay
Uh
he
says
the
straw
theyre
using
it
to
penetrate
a
hole
in
a
box
Okay
sorry
sorry
The
straw
represents
the
key
which
emits
a
great
energy
Theyre
using
this
energy
to
break
through
a
barrier
to
open
a
doorway
A
doorway
between
worlds
But
it
seems
this
key
was
only
half
the
equation
Location
Location
was
the
other
half
Oh
what
In
Hawkins
this
door
had
been
opened
once
It
was
still
healing
Jesus
Christ
So
this
door
is
open
now
He
says
it
is
opening
Where
are
you
going
To
call
our
children
Can

watch
Looney
Tunes
now
Nyet
Can
I
help
you
with
something
Whiskey
You
have
whiskey
No
but
I
do
have
vodka
Oh
If
theres
a
way
to
start
this
key
theres
gotta
be
a
way
to
stop
it
yeah
Turn
it
off
Right
Right
The
key
is
there
a
way
to
turn
it
off
He
says
Of
course
he
could
turn
it
off
Could
Edison
not
turn
off
a
lamp
could
Bell
not
hang
up
a
phone
Cocky
bastard
But
But
what
But
he
is
now
naked
Sorry
exposed
Compromised
Hey
I
will
get
you
there
I
will
get
you
to
your
key
You
wanna
ask
him
what
the
hells
so
funny
about
that
He
says
he
likes
your
courage
You
remind
him
of
a
Fat
Rambo
But
he
says
that
even
thin
Rambo
couldnt
get
there
This
key
it
is
in
an
underground
fortress
designed
by
the
greatest
Russian
minds
guarded
by
their
greatest
warriors
Breaking
in
is
impossible
Jackpot

Demogorgon

Big

A
deadly
weapon
Could
be
useful
For
what
What
do
you
think
Taking
down
Commies
saving
your
friends
Thought
you
were
more
realistic
than
that
nerd
We
dont
even
know
where
they
are
and
even
if
we
did
there
are
a
million
guards
up
there
with
weapons
way
deadlier
than
that
The
best
thing
we
can
do
for
them
is
to
get
out
of
here
and
find
help
Easy
with
that
Our
chance
of
surviving
and
theirs
rises
substantially
Just

The

Harrington

too
trippy
man
Were
not
gonna

Were
gonna
get
out
of
here
okay
Just
You
gotta
let
me
just
think
for
a
second
Do
you
remember
um
Mrs
Clicks
sophomore
history
class
What
Mrs
ClickityClackity
Thats
what
us
band
dweebs
called
her
It
was
first
period
Tuesdays
and
Thursdays
so
you
were
always
late
And
you
always
had
the
same
breakfast
Bacon
egg
and
cheese
on
a
sesame
bagel
I
sat
behind
you
two
days
a
week
for
a
year
Mister
Funny
Mister
Cool
The
King
of
Hawkins
High
himself
Do
you
even
remember
me
from
that
class
Of
course
you
dont
You
were
a
real
asshole
you
know
that
Yeah
I
know
But
it
didnt
even
matter
It
didnt
matter
that
you
were
an
ass
I
was
still
obsessed
with
you
Even
though
all
of
us
losers
pretend
to
be
above
it
all
we
still
just
wanna
be
popular
accepted
normal
If
it
makes
you
feel
any
better
having
those
things
isnt
all
that
great
Seriously
It
just
baffles
me
Everything
that
people
tell
you
is
important
everything
that
people
say
you
should
care
about
its
all
just
Bullshit
But
I
guess
you
gotta
mess
up
to
figure
things
out
right
I
hope
so
I
feel
like
my
whole
life
has
been
one
big
error
Yep
At
least
it
cant
get
any
more
messed
up
than
this
You
know
I
wish
Id
known
you
in
Clicks
class
Yeah
Really
I
do
Maybe
you
couldve
helped
me
pass
the
class
Maybe
instead
of
being
here
Id
be
on
my
way
to
college
right
now
And
I
would
have
no
idea
that
there
were
evil
Russians
beneath
our
feet
and
I
would
be
happily
slinging
ice
cream
with
some
other
schmuck
Gotta
say
though
I
liked
being
your
schmuck
It
was
fun
while
it
lasted
It
was
Where
were
you
two
going
Try
telling
the
truth
this
time
yes
It
will
make
your
visit
with
Dr
Zharkov
less
painful
Wait
a
second
Wait
Hold
on
Okay
Wait
wait
wait
What
is
that
thing
It
will
help
you
talk
Did
you
even
clean
that
thing
Whats
he
doing
now
And
thats
not
normal
right
Billy
staying
in
his
room
on
the
Fourth
of
July
No
thats
not
normal
He
wants
us
to
find
him
Yeah
thats
what
Im
afraid
of
If
we
go
to
Billy
then
the
rest
of
the
flayed
know
where
we
are
Its
a
trap
I
agree
Well
be
ambushed
We
wont
be
surprised
Well
know
that
theyre
coming
and
we
will
kick
their
flayed
butts
You
mean
El
will
kick
their
butts
Papa
No
Rainbow
Three
to
the
right
four
to
the
left
Sunflower
Rainbow
Its
too
risky
Yeah
and
unnecessary
Killing
the
flayed
wont
stop
the
Mind
Flayer
We
have
to
find
out
where
its
spreading
from
We
have
to
find
the
source
Billy
knows
it
Billys
been
there
To
the
source
Yeah
but
Its
a
trap
I
know
We
cant
go
to
Billy
but
I
think
theres
another
way
A
way
for
me
to
see
where
hes
been
El
I
know
you
think
you
have
to
do
this
but
you
dont
Its
just
youve
only
done
this
before
once
And
your
mom
she
loved
you
and
wanted
you
to
know
what
happened
And
Billys
mind
is
is
sick
diseased
The
Mind
Flayer
is
in
him
He
cant
hurt
me
Not
in
there
We
dont
know
that
Mike
I
need
you
to
trust
me

traveler
Sorry

Okay

Im
never

What
are
we

here
Were
laying
low
Cooling
off
Like
Oswald
Oswald
was
found
in
a
theater
and
shot
to
death
A
week
later
The
point
is
his
plan
didnt
work
Only
because
it
was
a
setup
What
He
was
just
a
patsy
Tell
me
youre
joking
Shh
Shh
We
need
to
get

here
All

Tweedledee

Where

To

the
machine
Sorry
keys
Two
keys
Twoman
rule
Twoman
rule
Yeah
two
men
two
keys
like
a
nuclear
launch
But
uh
to
retrieve
the
keys
there
is
a
vault
And
to
open
the
vault
you
need
to
enter
Plancks
constant
Plancks
what
Plancks
constant
Its
a
very
famous
number
All
right
so
we
get
the
keys
and
then
we
turn
the
machine
off
Thats
what
he
says
All
right
well
that
shouldnt
be
too
hard
We
can
do
this
Joyce
did
you
hear
the
part
where
he
said
the
place
was
like
an
impenetrable
fortress
Yeah
but
there
has
to
be
a
way
in
Yeah
there
is
Our
military
Who
are
coming
Well
we
dont
know
that
anymore
because
you
yelled
at
them
like
it
was
a
parentteacher
conference
and
then
you
hung
up
on
them
so
we
dont
know
what
the
hells
going
on
because
now
were
Wait
wait
what
are
we
do
Oh
Wait
thats
right
Were
on
our
way
to
rescue
our
children
from
the
big
bad
Fourth
of
July
celebration
You
know
what
if
you
cant
handle
this
then
just
turn
around
and
drop
me
off
first
What
are
you
gonna
do
You
gonna
walk
back
to
Hawkins
I
will
do
anything
if
it
gets
me
away
from
you
Children
Children
Children
This
interminable
bickering
was
amusing
at
first
but
its
getting
very
stale
and
weve
still
got
a
long
drive
ahead
of
us
So
why
dont
you
two
cut
the
horseshit
and
get
to
the
part
where
you
admit
your
sexual
feelings
for
one
another
Whoa
You
are
way
off
base
buddy
Oh
spare
me
spare
me
spare
me
Yes
yes
hes
a
brute
I
know
Probably
reminds
you
of
a
bad
relationship
and
gosh
youd
really
like
a
nice
man
to
settle
down
with
but
admit
it
youre
real
curious
to
know
what
hes
like
in
the
sack
And
you
Ha
Well
youre
just
a
big
manbaby
whod
rather
act
tough
than
show
his
true
feelings
because
the
last
time
you
opened
your
heart
you
got
hurt
Owie
And
now
rather
than
admit
these
feelings
youre
dancing
around
one
another
with
this
mindnumbing
and
frankly
boorish
mating
ritual
So
please
for
my
sake
either
quit
your
bickering
or
pull
over
tear
off
those
clothes
and
get
it
over
with
already
What
was
that
I
told
them
they
should
have
sex
They
have
not
had
sex
No
Oh
Oh
Okay
get
her
down
Okay
Lemme
see
Oh
shit
What
What
Hey
what
are
you
doing
Im
cleaning
the
wound
No
first
we
need
to
stop
the
bleeding
then
clean
then
disinfect
then
bandage
I
skateboard
Trust
me
Mike
hold
this
Keep
the
pressure
on
it
nice
and
firm
okay
Were
gonna
need
water
soap
Yeah

All
right
Does
any
of
this
help
No
Go
get
me
a
washcloth
and
a
bowl
A
bowl
Lucas
Go
Okay
What
did
that
thing
look
like
to
you
Like
that
thing
in
the
hospital
only
bigger
Yeah
a
lot
bigger
Like
Tom
and
Bruce
they
merged
to
become
one
right
And
And
Driscoll
kept
saying
how
she
needed
to
go
back
to
the
source
Wait
you
think
Driscolls
in
there
Maybe
And
And
And
maybe
Heather
and
Janet
too
and
God
knows
who
else
I
dont
know
how
were
gonna
kill
this
thing
but
if
we
do
We
kill
all
the
flayed
And
we
end
this
Maybe
All
I
know
is
we
need
El
Bowl
Bowl
Bowl
Why
wouldnt
it
be
with
the
cereal
I
dont
know
What
else

you
use
a
bowl

I
dont
know
Oh

Satans
Baby
You

shot
one
of
these
suckers
No
Is

an
understatement
That
doesnt

bowl
Nah

There
is
a
reason
this
warning
label
says
or
older
This
sucker

filled

gunpowder
Strap

a
priss
Hm
Turns

not
really
Are
you
still
in

little
bit
better
for
me

crazy
Ever
since
Dustin
got

hes
been
saying
You

Suzie
You

find
your
Suzie
Wait

some
girl
from

I
guess
his
girlfriend
To
be
honest
with
you
Im
not
sure
shes
even
real
But
thats
not
thats
not
really
the
point
That
doesnt
matter
The
point
is
this
girl
you

the
one
that
I
like
its
somebody
that
I
didnt
even
talk
to
in
school
And
I
dont

Maybe
cause
Tommy

First
of

time
And
shes
smart
Way
smarter
than

You
know

crack
like

you
Do
you
remember
what
I
said
about
Clicks
class
About
me
being
jealous
and
like
obsessed
Yeah
It
isnt
because
I
had
a
crush
on
you
Its
because
she
wouldnt
stop
staring
at
you
Mrs
Click
Tammy
Thompson
I
wanted
her
to
look
at
me
But
she
couldnt
pull
her
eyes
away
from
you
and
your
stupid
hair
And
I
didnt
understand
because
you
would
get
bagel
crumbs
all
over
the
floor
And
you
asked
dumb
questions
And
you
were
a
douchebag
And
And
you
didnt
even
like
her
and
I
would
go
home
and
just
scream
into
my
pillow
But
Tammy
Thompsons

girl
Steve

Oh
Oh
Holy
shit

a
total
dud
She

She
wants
to
be
like

She
wants
to

to
like
Nashville

She
has
dreams
She
cant
even
hold
a
tune
Shes
practically
tonedeaf
Have
you

her
All

a
Muppet
She

a
Muppet
giving
birth
And
if
you
could
hold
me
tight
Well

holding
on

Exactly
I
know
Okay
What
the
hell
And
why
all

like
turning
off
a
car
But
then
the
car
still
works

it
not
Yes
And
do
you
want
the
car
to
still
work

you
want
it
to
explode

the
car
to
explode

Then
do
this
Just
make
sure
you
are
nowhere
near
it
when
it
does
It
is
not
pretty
Turns

into
dust

a
high
enough
frequency
band

the
Russians
radio
tower
But
for

you
need

access
to
a
superpowered
handcrafted
radio
tower
one
preferably
already
situated

in
Hawkins
Oh

his
soul
rest
in
peace
Which
should
give

an
opening
to

the
keys
from
the

And

we
just
follow
the
map
to
the
observation
room
turn
the
key
Kaboom

blow
this
sucker
skyhigh
Yeah
And
then
once
the
rift
is
closed
we
escape
back
through
the
vents
Right
under
their
commie
noses
Then
home

Uh
Oh

A

B

time
constraints
Dare

Did
you
talk
to
your
mom
About
Thanksgiving
Yeah
Yeah
yeah
yeah
I
got
the
okay
Ill

there
And
then
I
was
thinking

you
could
come
up
here
for
Christmas
And
Will
too
You
can
come
before
or
after
Christmas
or
whatever
Mrs
Byers
wants
but
I
was
thinking
Christmas
Day
could
be
super
fun
because
wed
all
have
cool
new
presents
to
play
with
and
uh
Sorry
that
made
me
sound
like
a
sevenyearold
I
like
presents
too
Yeah
cool
Yeah
I
like
I
like
presents
too
Cool
Mike
Yeah
Remember
that
day
at
the
cabin
you
were
talking
to
Max
Um
I
dont
think
I
follow
You
talked
about
your
your
feelings
your
heart
Oh
Oh
yeah
that
Man
that
was
so
long
ago
Um
That
was
really
heat
of
the
moment
stuff
and
we
were
arguing
and
I
dont
really
remember
What
did
I
say
exactly
Mike
I
love
you
too
Donation
box
Uh
yeah
sure
What
is
that
Uh
It
Its
the
speech
Hop
wrote
for
you
and
Mike
Speech
Yeah
You
know
the
hearttoheart
He
never
talked
to
you
did
he
Can
I
read
Theres
something
Ive
been
wanting
to
talk
to
you
both
about
I
know
this
is
a
difficult
conversation
but
I
care
about
you
both
very
much
And
I
know
that
you
care
about
each
other
very
much
And
thats
why
its
important
that
we
set
these
boundaries
moving
forward
so
we
can
build
an
environment
where
we
all
feel
comfortable
trusted
and
open
to
sharing
our
feelings
Feelings
Feelings
Jesus
The
truth
is
for
so
long
Id
forgotten
what
those
even
were
Ive
been
stuck
in
one
place
in
a
cave
you
might
say
A
deep
dark
cave
And
then
I
left
some
Eggos
out
in
the
woods
and
you
came
into
my
life
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
I
started
to
feel
things
again
I
started
to
feel
happy
But
lately
I
guess
Ive
been
feeling
distant
from
you
Like
youre
youre
pulling
away
from
me
or
something
I
miss
playing
board
games
every
night
making
tripledecker
Eggo
extravaganzas
at
sunrise
watching
westerns
together
before
we
doze
off
But
I
know
youre
getting
older
Growing
Changing
And
I
guess
if
Im
being
really
honest
thats
what
scares
me
I
dont
want
things
to
change
So
I
think
maybe
thats
why
I
came
in
here
to
try
to
maybe
stop
that
change
To
turn
back
the
clock
To
make
things
go
back
to
how
they
were
But
I
know
thats
naive
Its
just
not
how
life
works
Its
moving
Always
moving
whether
you
like
it
or
not
And
yeah
sometimes
its
painful
Sometimes
its
sad
And
sometimes
its
surprising
Happy
So
you
know
what
Keep
on
growing
up
kid
Dont
let
me
stop
you
Make
mistakes
learn
from
em
and
when
life
hurts
you
because
it
will
remember
the
hurt
The
hurt
is
good
It
means
youre
out
of
that
cave
But
please
if
you
dont
mind
for
the
sake
of
your
poor
old
dad
keep
the
door
open
three
inches
I
I
will
be
king
Are
you
okay
Yeah
Time
to
go
Yeah
Ill

out

a
minute
Okay
Oh

could
be
heroes

one
day

one
day

Standing
Standing

the
wall
And

guns
Shot

heads

speed
up
or
slow
down
We
are
all
time
travelers
if
you
think
about
it
For
example
this
week
is
going
very
fast
I
think
because
I
am
so
busy
I
have
to
make
something
called
a
visual

A

Prick
Will
is
painting
a
lot
but
he
he
wont

Maybe
it

a
girl
I
think
there
is
someone
he
likes
because
he
has
been
acting
weird
Jonathan
is
acting
weird
also
I
think
he
is
just
nervous
about
college
He
is
still
waiting
for
his
big
letter
I
hope
he
and
Nancy
get
to
go
together
Damn
it
But
I
dont
know
how
hell
get
to
college
because
his
car
is
still
broken
His
funny
friend
Argyle
has
been
taking
us
to
school
His
hair
is
longer
than
mine
And
he
and
Jonathan
like
to
smoke
smelly
plants
together
Jonathan
says
the
plants
are
super
safe
because
they
come
from
the
earth
but
to
not
tell
Joyce
Me
I
am
twice
as

I
can
speak
for
all
of
us
when
I
say
its
been
a
tough
year
for
Hawkins
So
much
loss
And
sometimes
I
wonder
How
much
loss
can
one
community
take
In
dark
days
like
this
we
need
something
to
believe
in
So
last
night
when
we
were
down
by
ten
points
at
half
to
Christian
Academy
I
looked
at
my
team
and
I
said
Think
of
Jack
Think
of
Melissa
Think
of
Heather
Think
of
Billy
Think
about
our
heroic
police
chief
Jim
Hopper
Think
about
every
one
of
our
friends
who
perished
in
that
fire
What
did
they
die
for
For
us
to
lose
to
some
some
crap
school
No
No
For
us
to
return
home
with
our
heads
hung
low
in
defeat
No
No
No
Lets
win
this
game
Lets
win
this
game
for
them
And
thats
exactly
what
we
did
We
embarrassed
those
candyasses
in
their
own
house
and
now
tonight
tonight
were
gonna
bring
home
the
championship
trophy
Lets
go
Tonight
How
is
that
possible
They
call
it
a
tournament
You
win
one
game
you
go
on
until
theres
only
one
team
left
I
dont
get
the
big
deal
Just
talk
to
Eddie
Get
him
to
move
Hellfire
to
another
night
Just
talk
to
Eddie
Why
dont
you
just
talk
to
your
coach
and
get
him
to
move
the
game
I
think
thats
a
great
idea
Mike
Thank

Dustin
This
is
the
championship
game
And
this
is
the
end
of
Eddies
campaign
A
semester

the
popular
crowd

then
you
guys
will
be
too
Has
it
ever
occurred
to
you

be
popular
You

be
stuck
with
the
nerds
and
freaks
for
three
more
years
We

nerds

freaks
But
maybe
we
dont
have
to
be
Look
Im
tired
of
being
bullied
Im
tired
of
girls
laughing
at
us
Im
tired
of
feeling
like
a
loser
We
came
to
high
school
wanting
things
to
be
different
Right
So

that

After

she
traveled
the
world
to
spread
her
message
and
along
the
way
changed
how
the
world
perceived
those
like
her
with
disabilities
And
that
is
why
I
have
chosen
Helen
Keller
as
my
hero
That
was
wonderful
Angela
Truly
wonderful
What
an
inspiring
story
Okay
Now
lets
see
who
has
to
follow
that
Jane
Hi
For
my
hero
I
I
chose
my
dad
And
for
my
visual
aid
I
made
a
direyama
of
our
cabin
More
like
diarrhea
Quiet
everyone
Lets
be
respectful
This
is
my
dad
His
name
is
Hopper
He
made
the
best
Eggos
and
we
liked
to
watch
Miami
Vice
on
Fridays
This
is
MrFibbly
He
is
a
squirrel
What
And
this
is
the
alarm
that
my
dad
made
I
I
was
never
scared
because
Beca
because
Uh
Angela
lets
save
questions
until
the
end
of
Janes
presentation
Yeah
Sorry

thought
this
was
a
presentation
about
a
historical
hero
My
dad
was
in
the
newspaper
Your
local
paper
I
just
dont
think

what
Mrs
Gracey
meant
by
historical
This
is
supposed
to
be
about
famous
people
My
dad
is
famous
He
He
saved
lots
of
lives
In
a
mall
fire

If

Snap

Then
Vicki
laughed
And
it
wasnt
like
a
cheap
fake
laugh
either
It
was
like
It
was
a
real
genuine
laugh
Of
course
Its
my
Muppet
joke
Its
hilarious
My
point
is
that
Vicki
laughed
and
everything
was
just
like
It
was
perfect
But
But
Im
having
this
problem
where
its
like
I
should
stop
talking
I
have
said
everything
I
need
to
say
But
then
I
guess
I
get
nervous
and
the
words
keep
spilling
out
and
its
like
my
my
brain
is
moving
faster
than
my
mouth
or
or
rather
my
my
mouth
is
moving
faster
than
my
brain
Im
digging
this
hole
for
myself
and
I
want
to
stop
digging
Im
trying
to
stop
but
I
cant
And
Im
doing
it
right
now
arent
I
Yeah
you
are
Oh
Im
hopeless
Eh
We
both
are
If
only
we
could
just
like
combine
Combine
No
think
about
it
I
know
exactly
what
I
want
and
Ive
found
the
girl
of
my
dreams
but
I
cant
get
the
courage
to
ask
her
out
Mm
Meanwhile
you
go
on
a
million
dates
And
you
have
no
idea
what
you
want
Mmhmm
So
if
we
just
combined
all
our
problems
would
be
solved
Because
I
mean
alone
lets
face
it
We
totally
suck
Totally
and
utterly
Ooh
I
think
I
found
our
morning
movie
Doctor
Zhivago
Ugh
you

I
dont

double
VHS
But
its
about
doomed
love
Oh

a
joke
We

Chrissy
Cunningham
Youre

Yes
in
her
cheerleader
outfit
Same
thing
she
was
in
when
I
saw
her
with
Eddie
Did
you
tell
all
this
to
the
cops
No
No
but
I
I
cant
be
the
only
one
who
saw
them
together
They
stood
out
Eddie
the
freak
with
Chrissy
the
cheerleader
Exactly
You
know
his
names
not
in
the
news
yet
or
anything
but
I
guarantee
you
Eddie
is
suspect
one
now
Thats
crazy
Eddie
didnt
do
this
No
way
No
way
We
cant
rule
it
out
Yes
we
can
Dustin
You
dont
know
him
like
I
do
Max
Okay
When
we
got
to
high
school
Lucas
made
all
his
sports
friends
Mike
and
me
I
mean
no
one
was
nice
to
us
No
one
except
Eddie
Okay
Well
they
said
the
same
shit
about
Ted
Bundy
Yeah
hes
a
super
nice
guy
but
then
hes
murdering
women
on
the
weekend
So
youre
saying
Eddie
is
like
Ted
Bundy
No
Im
not
saying
Im
saying
that
we
cant
presume
anything
okay
But
it
doesnt
look
good
for
Eddie
Why
havent
you
told
the
cops
this
I
I
dont
know
You
dont
know
After
I
saw
Eddie
and
Chrissy
go
in
the
trailer
something
else
happened
Okay
all
right
Last
one
Come
on
Nothing
that
weird
or
anything
I
mean
Eddie
always
drives
like
a
maniac
and
the
power
goes
off
at
my
place
all
the
time
Its
a
piece
of
shit
But
This
morning
I
started
to
think
back
and
I
dont
know
The
look
on
his
face
He
was
scared
Dustin
Really
scared
Maybe
he
was
scared
because
you
know
he
he
just
killed
someone
or
Maybe
um
Maybe
be
because
I
dont
I
dont
know
maybe
Something
else
killed
her
But
thats
impossible
Right
I
dont
know
It
should
be
Only
one
person
knows
what
actually
happened
Eddie
Have
you
talked
to
anyone
else
No
I
cant
find
Lucas
or
Nancy
and
Mikes
in
California
Shit

A
friend

here
Yes
there

signed
Enzo
So
So
Theres
only
two
people
who
knew
about
our
date
at
Enzos
and
thats
me
and
Hop
So
whoever
wrote
this
Hop
trusted
enough
to
make
him
sign
it
Enzo
Hes
sending
me
a
message
You
saw
him
die
Joyce
I
didnt
see
a
body
Because
he
evaporated
Or
He
survived
Okay
Okay
Lets
indulge
this
fantasy
for
a
moment
Hes
Houdini
Hes
a
cat
man
with
nine
lives
Whatever
it
is
he
survives
Whats
he
doing
in
Russia
He
was
captured
thats
what
Then
he
probably
met
some
new
friends
And
by
friends
I
mean
the
KGB
And
believe
me
when
I
tell
you
these
people
are
the
worst
of
the
worst
I
am
talking
torture
Joyce
And
no
matter
how
strong
you
think
Jim
is
they
will
break
him
They
will
get
his
whole
life
story
And
yes
that
might
very
well
include
a
planned
date
atEnzos
with
you
his
coconspirator
making
this
all
an
elaborate
ruse
to
capture
you
as

Forty

Yuris
Fish

Two

Well
that
wasnt
the
KGB
But
it
wasnt
a
friend
either
So
were
both
wrong
Who
the
hell
was
that
Still
alive
But
he
is
barely
breathing
More
of
this
he
will
die
You
are
strong
American
Perhaps
the
Motherland
could
use
that
strength
Send
him
to
Kamchatka
I
never
knew
you
to
be
generous
You
clearly
do
not
know
Kamchatka
Doctor
This
man
does
not
deserve
the
peace
of
death
So
I
have
sent
him
to
Hell
Present
arms
Lieutenant
Colonel
welcome
to
Indiana
Eddie
Munson
Hes
a
part
of
that
freak
devil
cult
Hellfire
The
cops
they
say
Chrissy
went
to
him
to
buy
drugs
Drugs
No
Thats
what
I
said
Chrissy
would
never
touch
that
shit
They
wouldnt
even
show
her
parents
her
face
I
dont
know
what
this
freak
did
to
Chrissy
but
he
did
something
sick
Probably
sacrificed
her
drained
her
blood
for
the
devil
Satanists
do
that
Thats
what
Im
saying
Its
this
cult
Hellfire
isnt
a
cult
Its
Its
just
a
DD
club
D
DD
Dungeons
Dragons
Its
like
a
Its
like
a
game
It
Its
fantasy
And
how
exactly
is
it
you
know
all
of
that
Sinclair
Uh
Well
its
my
sister
Yeah
shes
like
Shes
like
a
total
nerd
You
know
Yeah
Nerds
Like
she
plays
a
lot
sometimes
Im
sure
your
sister
isnt
killing
people
right
But
Ive
read
the
wrong
person
plays
this
game
it
can
warp
their
mind
They
confuse
fantasy
and
reality
and
innocent
people
die
Been
happening
all
over
the
country
Its
an
epidemic
Ive
read
about
that
shit
Its
real
And
I
think
Eddie
Hes
the
wrong
type
of
person
right
You
know
he
got
lost
He
thought
Chrissy
was
just
a
part
of
his
his
sick
game
And
chances
are
hes
still
in
the
game
Meaning
Hes
gonna
kill
again
But
not
if
we
can
help
it
Would
Chrissy
want
us
to
just
stand
by
while
the
cops
go
around
pursuing
some
bullshit
leads
spreading
rumors
saying
shes
some
druggy
No
No
shed
want
us
to
go
out
there
To
do
something
about
it
wouldnt
she
Yeah
Then
lets
hunt
some
freak
Yeah
For
Chrissy
Yeah
Lets
go
Yeah
I
cant
seem
to
face
up
to
the
facts
Im
tense
and
nervous
And
I
cant
relax
Lets
go
I
cant
sleep
cause
my
beds
on
fire
Dont
touch
me
Im
a
real
live
wire
Have
you
seen
or
heard
from
Eddie
recently
Eddie
Munson
Whens
the
last
time
you
talked
to
him
Seen
him
Okay
Sorry
to
bother
you
Know
anyone
whod
know
where
he
is
I
really
dont
think
hes
at
the
arcade
Yep
Im
pretty
sure
Reefer
Rick
No
Does
this
Reefer
Rick
have
a
last
name
I
mean
its
kind
of
All
right
Doctor
Zhivago
Its
a
double
VHS
Its
long
But
thats
because
its
filled
with
action
and
romance
and
a
little
bit
of
suspense
So
my
boyfriend
wont
like
totally
puke
when
I
bring
it
home
Oh
you
your
boyfriend
Uh
no
No
Hes
gonna
Hes
gonna
love
it
Yeah
See
ya
Yeah
see
ya
later
Alligator
Goddammit
Hey
guys
I
might
have
a
lead
Seriously
Yeah
Apparently
Eddie
gets
drugs
from
some
guy
named
Reefer
Rick
and
sometimes
Eddie
crashes
there
Sounds
promising
Where
does
Reefer
Rick
live
See
thats
the
thing
No
one
knows
Hes
more
of
a
a
legend
than
someone
that
people
actually
know
Last
name
I
dont
know
that
either
Bet
the
cops
know
the
last
name
What
Cops
I
mean
listen
if
this
Reefer
Rick
is
actually
a
drug
dealer
I
guarantee
you
hes
been
busted
at
some
point
Means
hes
in
the
system
The
cops
Really
Steve
Thats
your
suggestion
I
think
they
should
be
filled
in
on
what
we
know
whats
going
on
You
think
Eddies
guilty
dont
you
Whoa
I
believe
in
innocent
until
proven
guilty
all
that
constitutional
shit
I
just
you
know
dont
think
we
can
rule
it
out
Thats
precisely
what
were
trying
to
do
here
Steve
And
maybe
wed
have
a
little
bit
more
luck
if
you
spent
less
time
trying
to
find
a
girlfriend
and
more
time
trying
to
find
Eddie
Somebody
has
to
attend
to
the
customers
Especially
if
theyre
babes
right
Hey
not
fair
Okay
I
attend
to
all
customers
equally
babes
and
nonbabes
alike
Weve
got
a
very
big
selection
in
here
It
can
be
super
overwhelming
for
people
Yeah
it
can
be
What
are
you
doing
Maybe
we
dont
need
a
last
name
Twelve
Ricks
have
accounts
here
Lot
of
Ricks
So
lets
narrow
it
down
Rick
Aldermans
latest
rentals

The

small
We

up
with
the
big
guys
And
Im
just
looking
for
something
anything
really
about
what

Why
Far
as
I
can
tell
you
all
have
it
figured
out
already
My
nephews

freak
He
killed
that
girl
Aint
that
about

Let
me
guess
Youve
been
speaking
to
the
Hawkins
Post
Chuck
Bailey

I

Let

tell
your
side
of
the
story
My
nephew
he
may
look
dangerous
but
he
didnt
do
this
It
just
aint
in
his
nature
No

You

his
mind
Killed
his
whole

Kids

wife
Took
their
eyes
Cut
em
right
out
God
That
poor

broke
out
Victor
Creel
is
still
alive
They
locked
him
away
in
Pennhurst
Asylum
Yeah
as
far
as
I

So
we
got
uh
some
good
news
and
some
bad
news
How
do
you
prefer
it
Bad
news
first
always
Dustin
All
right
Bad
news
We
tapped
into
the
Hawkins
PD
dispatch
with
ourCerebro
and
theyre
definitely
looking
for
you
Also
theyre
uh
pretty
convinced
you
killedChrissy
Like
kind
of
convinced
And
the
good
news
Robin
Your
name
hasnt
gone
public
yet
But
if
we
found
out
about
you
its
a
matter
of
time
before
others
do
And
once
that
gets
out
everyone
and
their
shallowminded
mother
is
gonna
be
gunning
for
you
Hunt
the
freak
right
Exactly
Shit
So
before
that
happens
we
find
Vecna
kill
him
and
prove
your
innocence
Thats
all
Dustin
Thats
all
Yeah
no
thats
pretty
much
it
Robin
Listen
Eddie
I
know
everything
Dustin
is
saying
sounds
totally
delusional
but
weve
actually
been
through
this
before
I
mean
they
have
a
a
few
times
and
and
I
have
once
Mine
was
more
humanfleshbased
theirs
was
more
smokerelated
but
bottom
line
is
collectively
I
really
feel
we
got
this
We
usually
rely
on
this
girl
who
has
super
powers
But
uh
those
went
byebye
so
So
were
technically
in

This

His

Nancy
Youre
saying
that
this
thing
that
killed
Fred
and
Chrissy
its
from
the
Upside
Down
If
the
shoe
fits
Our
working
theory
is
that
he
attacks
with
a
spell
or
a
curse
Now
whether
or
not
hes
doing
the
bidding
of
the
Mind
Flayer
or
just
loves
killing
teens
we
dont
know
All
we
know
is
this
is
something
different
Something
new
Doesnt
make
sense
Its
only
a
theory
No
Fred
and
Chrissy
dont
make
sense
I
mean
why
them

Maybe
they
were
just
in

Were
both
at

And
near

Were
at
the

park
Uh
should
we
maybe
not

There
is

Yeah
but
not
here
She
was
crying
in
the
bathroom
at
school
Serial
killers
stalk
their
prey
before
they
strike
right
So
maybe
Fred
andChrissy
saw
this
Vecman
Vecna
Dunno
about
you
but
if
I
saw
some
freaky
wizard
monster
I
would
mention
it
to
someone
Maybe
they
did
I
saw
Chrissy
leaving
Ms
Kelleys

If

Robin
in
English
Help
me
get
this
straight
Eddies
uncle
Wayne
thinks
that
Victor
Creel
escaped
from
Pennhurst
Asylum
and
that
hes
the
one
running
around
committing
these
murders
Pretty
much
But
Victor
committed
the
eyeball
murders
like
way
back
in
the
s
Well
So
that
means
these
murders
predate
Eleven
in
the
Upside
Down
by
about
years
Yeah
Which
makes
spooky
Victor
Creel
like
years
old
Yep
bell
chimes
So
hes
a
grandpa
murderer
who
can
turn
invisible
and
lift
people
into
the
air
It
doesnt
make
sense
I
know
Thats
why
I
said
it
was
a
shot
in
the
dark
I
know
I
just
thought
that
by
shot
in
the
dark
you
were
being
modest
or
hiding
something
super
solid
up
your
sleeve
that
you
were
gonna
wow
us
with
later
But
this
is
really
truly
a
shot
in
the
dark
Like
we
are
snipers
with
blindfolds
on
whove
been
spun
around
times
bell
dinging
rapidly
Coming
Hi
Sorry
were
in
a
bit
of
a
rush
Could
we
get
the
keys
to
the
basement
archives
Of
course
Give
me
one
sec
Did
I
come
off
mean
or
condescending
No
Right
plucky
music
playing
Sorry
Its
just
you
seem
annoyed
You
dont
know
me
well
I
dont
really
have
a
filter
or
a
strong
grasp
of
social
cues
Okay
If
I
say
something
that
upsets
you
just
know
that
I
know
its
a
flaw
Believe
me
my
mother
reminds
me
daily
Got
it
All
right
ladies
Here
you
go
Have
fun
Yep
Well
try
plucky
inquisitive
music
continues
doorbell
ringing
Max
Hi
Hi
Im
so
sorry
to
bother
you
over

but
do
you
have
a
minute
to
talk
Um
yeah
of
course
Of
course
Okay
Shes
in
Im
missing
collarbones
not
eyes
So

gonna
talk
about
it
Huh
Sorry
talk
about
what
Your
temporary
insanity
earlier
today
when
you
basically
threw
yourself
atNance
Thats
not
what
happened
Pretty
sure
thats
what
happened
It
was
public
There
were
a
lot
of
witnesses
You
implying
I
still
have
a
thing
for
Nance
No
Im
not
implying
Im
stating
And
as
it
relates
to
your
steadfast
refusal
to
date
Robin
its
pretty
much
the
only
logical
explanation
Thats
not
the
only
one
And
as
forNance
I
was
just
trying
to
protect
a
friend
A
friend
Henderson
Okay
Okay

wanna
find
her

all
the
murders
its
its

everything
worse
again
Youve
experienced
trauma
Max
and
when
you
keep
your
feelings
your
pain
bottled
up
the
way
you
do
it
doesnt
take
much
to
trigger
them
again
So
now
when
it
rains
it
storms
Yeah
I

Do
you

youre
ready
to
talk

about
that

Billy
I

Im

To

a

of
questions
Did
they
talk
to
you
I

I
know
you
were
seeing
Chrissy
Max
you
know
I
cant
talk
aboutChrissy
or
any
other
student
Yeah

I
mean
what
if
there
was
a
serial
killer
on
the
loose
in
my
neighborhood
Did
Chrissy
mention
anything
Anything
about
who
might
have
done
this
Max
Im
Im
sorry
I
I
really
cant
discuss
this
You
wouldnt
want
me
talking
to
any
other
students
about
you
right
If
I
were
dead
and
it
would
help
catch
the
killer
then
yeah
I
most
definitely
would
Well

that
up

Things
in

I

Okay
Its
starting
to
seem
like
this
was
just
a
big
waste
of
time
Youre
obviously
bored
Why
dont
you
call
Steve
Im
sure
hell
pick
you
up
And
I
mean
Im
not
really
in
danger
here
so
You
do
know
that
Steve
and
I
are
like
totally
not
a
thing
right
What
So
I
figure
you
and
Jonathan
are
still
going
strong
cause
you
guys
are
going
to
college
together
Youre
one
of
those
unstoppable
power
couples
but
II
just
I
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you
knew
that
Steve
and
I
are
just
friends

First
UFOs

real
Bigfoot
Im
still
on
the
fence
about
But
may
I
remind
you
we
are

Victor
Creel
claims
vengeful
demon
killed
family
The
murder
that
shocked
a
small
community
Ha
ha
Thats
very
funny
Im
not
kidding
Get
over
here
According
to
several
insiders
Victor
believed
his
house
was
haunted
by
an
ancient
demon
Victor
allegedly
hired
a
priest
to
exorcise
the
demon
from
his
home
Pretty
novel
for
the
s
Exorcist
wasnt
out
yet
Keep
Keep
going
Okay
so
Victor
claimed
this
exorcism
failed
but
it
angered
this
demon
which
then
murdered
his
family
removing
their
eyes
Victor
believed
he
was
spared
as
a
punishment
Thats
pretty
convenient
for
Victor
Yeah
or
super
inconvenient
Victor
was
declared
legally
insane
by
the
court
right
What
if
this
is
why
It
sounds
insane
Just
didnt
go
public
because
The
plea
bargain
The
records
were
sealed
What
if
a
demon
did
invade
Victors
home
Its
just
this
demon
wasnt
any
old
demon
It
was
Vecna
Dustin
do
you
copy
Dustin
Yeah
I

So
Nancys

Vecnas

Breaking

Sorry
about

I
I
didnt

you
But
you
got
yourself
into
quite
the
little
predicament
didnt
you
You
know
I
relocated
you
guys
to
Lenora
because
I
thought
you
know
Safe
town
small
dull
far
from
Hawkins
Nothing
could
happen
here
And
what
was
it
a
roller
skate
or
something
Ready
to
order
some
food
I
think
so
Yeah
Ill
just
uh
Some
more

How

Never

For

thing
No
no

no
Well
make
that
go
away
Dont
even
Dont
even
worry
about
that
Thats
not
why
youre
here
eerie
music
playing
To
be
honest
with
you
kid
I
I
wish
it
was
Last
night
I
saw
something
Something
Ive
been
dreading
for
some
time
I
dont
know
how
to
say
this
other
than
just
to
say
it
Hawkins
is
in
danger
creatures
screeching
energy

Vecna

You
have
fought
this
evil
before
and
youve
won
Eleven

But
this
evil
its
like
a
virus
Each
time
it
returns
it
comes
back
stronger

A
war
is
coming
to
Hawkins
Where
you
at
freak
dramatic

Jason
You
sure
Eddie
was
here
Yeah
I
Im
Im
positive
Lets
check
around
the
back
Around
the
back
Owens
There
are
good
people
brave
friends
who
have
helped
you
fight
your
battle
in
the
past
But
they
alone
cant
win
this
war
not
without
you
I
know
its
not
fair
to
ask
more
of
you
but
I
wouldnt
be
here
if
I
didnt
think
this
was
the
only
way
if
I
didnt
think
you
were
the
only
one
who
might
have
a
shot
to
hit
this
thing
so
hard
it
cant
get
back
up
I
dont
have
my
powers
What
if
I
told
you
there
was
a
way
A
way
to
bring
them
back
dramatic
music
playing
helicopter
whirring
I
feared
this
moment
would
come
so
Ive
been
preparing
developing
the
means
to
restore
your
abilities
A
program
has
the
potential
to
not
just
bring
them
back
but
bring
them
back
stronger
than
before
But
there
are
others
who
dont
believe
in
you
who
think
you
are
the
cause
I
believe
theyre
wrong
I
believe
youre
the
cure
Thats
why
if
were
really
gonna
do
this
Im
gonna
ask
that
you
leave
with
me
now
The
reservations
under
Byers
Owens
But
you
should
know
there
is
a
very
real
possibility
this
program
fails
And
if
it
does
you
will
never
see
your
friends
again
My
friends
in
Hawkins
are
they
in
danger
dramatic
music
continues
Owens
Im
afraid
your
friends
in
Hawkins
are
very
much
Can
I
see
Freds
file
Yeah
In
the
eye
of
the
storm
You
may
feel
you
need
to
go
to
them
now
but
if
you
do
you
will
risk
everything
risk
everyone

Because
I
believe
you
are
our

Our
only
hope
What
if
Im
not
good
What
if
Im
the
monster
I
dont
know
you
that
well
kiddo
but
Im
betting
the
fate
of
the
planet
that
youre
one
of
the
good
ones
But
youve
spent
too
much
of
your
life
being
told
what
to
do
by
people
like
me
I
know
that
So
you
say
the
word
and
I
will
take
you
back
home
Or
Come
with
me

Find
out

yourself

Im
sorry
Im
having
trouble
understanding
any
of
this
I
mean
what
exactly
is
going
on
in
Hawkins
Whats
doing
these
killings
Thats
what
were
trying
to
ascertain
Where
is
El
like
right
now
For
her
safety
its
best
you
dont
know
This
is
insane
This
is
insane
So
this
training
to
get
Els
powers
back
how
long
is
it
gonna
take
Could
take
weeks
could
take
months
Months
Until
then
agents
Harmon
and
Wallace
will
stay
with
you
Were
not
in
danger
Our
friends
live
in
Hawkins
My
family
lives
in
Hawkins
Ill
work
to
contain
the
situation
until
Eleven
is
ready
In
the
meantime
it
is
of
vital
importance
you
do
not
speak
to
anyone
about
this
No
No
way
I
know
this
is
difficult
to
understand
Its
not
difficult
This
is
impossible
There
are
factions
within
our
government
who
are
working
directly
against
Eleven
who
are
in
fact
searching
for
her
as
we
speak
We
cant
risk
contact
If
they
learned
about
any
of
this
it
will
jeopardize
Eleven
And
if
Eleven
is
jeopardized
so
are
your
friends
And
so
is
your
family
So
what
Were
just
supposed
to
trust

Were
friends
of
Owens
Eleven

us
Now

asking
the
same
from
you
For
you
It
was
here
Right

A
grandfather
clock
It
was
so
real
And
then
when
I
got
closer
suddenly
I

Max

on
Max
I
woke
up
It
was
like
she
was
in
a
trance
or
something
Exactly
what
Eddie
said

to
Chrissy
Thats
not
even
the
bad
part
Fred

both
came
to
Miss
Kelley
for
help
Uh

both
were
having
headaches

headaches
that
wouldnt
go
away
And
then
Then
the
nightmares
Trouble
sleeping
Theyd
wake
up
in
a
cold
sweat
Then
they
started
seeing
things
Bad
things
From
their
pasts
These
visions
they
just
They
kept
on
getting
worse
and
worse
until
eventually
Everything
ended
Vecnas
curse
Chrissys
headache
started
a
week
ago
Freds
six
days
ago
Ive
been
having
them
for
five
days
I
dont
know
how
long
I
have
All
I
know
is
that
for
Fred
and
Chrissy
they
both
died
less
than
hours
after
their
first
vision
And
I
just
saw
that
goddamn
clock
so
looks
like
Im
gonna
die
tomorrow
Stay

this
lamp
Sorry

biking
for
eight
miles
Give
me
a
second
Shit
Weve
got
a
code
red
What
Dustin
Ive
been
with
Jason
Patrick
and
Andy
and
theyve
gone
totally
off
the
rails
Theyre
trying
to
capture
Eddie
and
they
think
you
know
where
he
is
Youre
in
terrible
danger
All
right
Yeah
that
definitely
sucks
but
weve
got
bigger
problems
than
Jason
now
Would
you
get
the
door
Im
busy
I
said
get
the
door
This
is
unbelievable
Hey
there
Is
uh
is
Lucas
home
Negative
You
know
where
he
is
Uh
were
just
We
were
supposed
to
go
out
and
Go
out
I
see
hes
taken
a
step
down
from
Max
Im
sorry
Uh
well
youre
the
little
sister
who
plays
Dungeons
Dragons
huh
Whats
it
to
you
Do
you
know
Dustin
Henderson
Know
him
Ive
bled
with
him
Chances
are
hes
with
your
cheater
boyfriend
Oh
if
and
when
you
do
find
Lucas
please
tell
him
Ive
been
covering
for
his
ass
for
two
days
now
Each
day
of
covering
costs
ten
bucks
with
a
DPR
Thats
a
daily
percentage
rate
of
Another
week
of
this
and
hes
buying
me
a
goddamn
Nintendo
with
Duck
Hunt
Where
the
hells
Sinclair
Thats
what
were
about
to
find
out
Weve
been
tricked
boys
Okay
be
honest
Uh
You
guys
understand
any
of
this
No
Pretty
straightforward
Oh
straightforward
really
Whats
confusing
to
you
So
far
everyone
Vecna
has
cursed
has
died
except
for
this
old
Victor
Creel
dude
Nancy
found
Hes
the
only
known
survivor
If
anyone
knows
how
to
beat
this
curse
its
him
Thats
assuming
he
was
cursed
which
we
dont
even
know
How
can
Vecna
have
existed
in
the
s
It
doesnt
make
sense
Far
as
we
know
Eleven
didnt
create
the
Upside
Down
She
opened
a
gate
to
it
The
Upside
Down
has
probably
been
around
for
thousands
of
years
Millions
I
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
predated
the
dinosaurs
Dinosaurs
What
are
we
Okay
But
if
a
gate
didnt
exist
in
the
s
how
did
Vecna
get
through
Hows
he
getting
through
now
And
why
now
And
why
then
Just
pops
out
in
the
s
kills
one
family
and
hes
like
Im
good
And
poof
he
just
disappears
Just
gone
Only
to
return
years
later
and
start
killing
random
teens
No
I
dont
buy
it
Straightforward
my
ass
Honestly
Henderson
a
little
humility
now
and
then
it
wouldnt
hurt
you
Sorry
Any
idea
what
shes
writing
Did
she
sleep
I
mean
would
you
Okay
so
we
have
a
plan
Thanks
to
Nancys
minions
we
are
now
rockstar
psychology
students
at
the
University
of
Notre
Dame
Im
now
Ruth
And
Im
Rose
Ruth
Nice
GPA
Thanks
So
we
called
Pennhurst
Asylum
told
them
wed
like
to
speak
with
Creel
for
a
thesis
were
cowriting
on
paranoid
schizophrenics
To
which
they
said
no
But
we
landed
a
three
oclock
with
the
director
Now
all
we
have
to
do
is
charm
him
and
convince
him
to
let
us
talk
to
Victor
Then
maybe
we
can
rid
Max
of
this
curse
About
that
Weve
been
doing
our
Victor
Creel
homework
and
uh
we
got
some
questions
Lots
of
questions
So
do
we
Hopefully
Victor
has
the
answers
Wait
Wait
Wait
a
second
Uh
Wheres
mine
Nancy
youre
outta
your
mind
if
you
think
Im
babysitting
again
First
theyre
not
babies
anymore
And
Max
is
in
real
danger
She
needs
people
around
her
I
know
But
why
me
Oh
my
God
you
have
a
Tom
Cruise
poster
You
have
a
Tom
Cruise
poster
Thats
old
Its
just
Can
you
please
not
touch
anything
I
cant
do
anything
here
Nance
Maybe
I
can
be
helpful
with
this
asylum
director
dude
I
dont
know
I
could
turn
on
my
my
charm
Not
the
charm
we
need
Ouch
No
I
just
I
did
a
little
digging
last
night
and
it
turns
out
this
Dr
Hatch
is
a
distinguished
fellow
of
the
American
Psychiatric
Association
and
a
Harvard
visiting
scholar
okay
This
is
a
lifelong
student
of
the
world
If
were
gonna
win
him
over
were
gonna
have
to
convince
him
we
are
too
That
like
him
we
are
true
academic
scholars
Holy
shit
Theres
a
little
ballerina
in
here
Academic
scholar
Shes
giving
you
an
academic
scholar
vibe
Yeah
No
but
she
will
Oh
please
tell
me
youre
joking
Its
busy
Its
still
busy
Did
I
do
something
wrong
It
says
dial
one
then
the
number
which
You
can
check
on
your
kids
later
I
dont
understand
why
its
still
busy
Joyce
there
are
certain
things
one
can
be
late
to
in
life
A
dentists
appointment
A
oneyearolds
birthday
party
because
who
cares
Little
idiots
not
gonna
remember
it
But
for
what
is
essentially
a
ransom
exchange
for
that
for
that
I
think
you
very
much
need
to
be
on
time
Im
sorry
Im
very
tense
Clearly
Head
west
through
forest
You
will
see
a
church
with
a
gray
roof
Wait
inside
Yuri
will
meet
you
there
So
you
heard
from
her
Yeah
they
arrived
last
night
Theyre
meeting
Yuri
soon
If
all
goes
well
by
tomorrow
night
youre
home
eating
Enzos
with
your
sexy
woman
Shes
not
my
woman
Of
course
not
She
saves
your
life
because
of
friendship
Look
American
do
not
put
too
much
hope
into
this
dream
I
have
thought
long
about
this
and
I
give
you
odds
of
success
fifty
to
one
You
dont
even
seem
nervous
American
Im
impressed
Youre
a
cool
cat
Like
Steve
McQueen
The
Cooler
King
Yeah
Lets
hope
not
Of
course
not
because
Cooler
King
went
back
to
cooler
So
you
must
be
better
than
McQueen
today
I
change
mind
Now
I
give
you
odds
a
hundred
to
one
Our
nosy
friend
again
Where
do
you
want
it
Just
not
my
face
Of
course
not
Must
be
pretty
for
your
woman
Shes
not
my
woman
Amazing
you
can
get
this
many
people
and
have
it
this
quiet
Keep
in
mind
that
Where
are
you
going
Im
just
getting
something
to
drink
Is
that
allowed
or
How
does
this
house
arrest
work
Youre
not
under
arrest
Right
No
no
youre
youre
here
to
protect
us
And
watch
TV
apparently
I
I
mean
I
dont
think
theyve
thought
this
through
If
this
goes
on
for
a
month
or
months
and
people
cant
get
a
hold
of
us
theyre
gonna
totally
freak
out
Meanwhile
my
moms
probably
having
a
panic
attack
And
what
about
Hawkins
That
ladys
supposed
to
keep
it
contained
Like
you
can
contain
any
of
this
without
El
I
mean
Yeah
If
you
keep
staring
at
that
its
not
gonna
change
You
know
Yeah
Yeah
youre
right
Before
the
cops
came
me
and
El
we
we
had
a
bad
fight
We
never
fight
I
mean
we
fought
before
but
just
like
silly
fights
stupid
fights
But
I
dont
know
this
one
just
felt
more
adult
Like
it
it
just
felt
more
real
Like
a
fightyou
cant
come
back
from
Maybe
I
shouldve
said
something
and
if
I
wouldve
said
that
thing
then
maybe
shed
want
me
there
with
her
wherever
she
is
No
Look
Mike
youre
gonna
see
her
again
and
whatever
you
didnt
say
you
can
say
it
to
her
then
Okay
Yeah
Yeah
Shes
gonna
be
okay
Shes
not
in
Hawkins
Thats
what
we
should
be
worrying
about
You
dont
trust
Owens
No
I
dont
know
I
mean
hes
been
good
to
us
and
good
to
El
but
he
wasnt
able
to
protect
me
That
was
you
guys
who
saved
me
That
was
you
guys
Looks
like
its
gonna
be
up
to
us
again
It
always
is
isnt
it
Which
is
why
we
cant
stay
here
Listen
lets
assume
these
friends
of
Owens
are
telling
the
truth
We
cant
call
Hawkins
without
alerting
the
military
putting
El
in
danger
Fine
Then
well
just
go
to
them
Go
to
Hawkins
How
What
are
you
worried
about
Ponch
and
Jon
out
there
Theyre
halfasleep
now
watching
golf
No
Jonathan
I
mean
we
dont
have
a
car
or
money
Then
well
hail
ourselves
a
ride
A
cheap
one
Excuse
me
sir
Excuse
me
sir
What
Were

eat
Surfs
up
Surfer
Boy
Pizza
this
is
Argyle
speaking
We
make
everything
fresh
here
at
Surfer
Boy
except
for
our
pineapple
which
comes
from
a
can
But
I
still
highly
recommend
slapping
some
juicy
pineapple
on
your
pie
Oh
fruit
on
your
pizzas
gnarly
you
say
Well
I
say
try
before
you
deny
Hello
I
know
you
guys
are
staring
at
me
What
sorry
You
said
you
needed
something
Just
hanging
out
How
you
think
your
eyes
boring
into
the
back
of
my
head
is
protecting
me
from
Vecna
I
dont
know
You
can
look
at
me
now
Thank
you
Sorry
Sorry
Sorry
For
you
For
you
And
um
you
Oh
and
um
give
these
to
Mike
El
and
Will
If
you
can
ever
get
a
hold
of
them
again
What
are
you
doing
No
dont
Thats
not
for
now
Dont
open
it
now
Dont
Okay
Im
sorry
What
is
this
Its
um
Its
a
failsafe
For
after
If
things
dont
work
out
Wait
whoa
Max
things
are
gonna
work
out
No
No
I
dont
need
you
to
reassure
me
and
tell
me
its
all
gonna
work
out
People
have
been
telling
me
that
my
entire
life
and
its
almost
never
true
Its
never
true
I
mean
of
course
this
asshole
curses
me
Shouldve
seen
that
one
coming
If
we
go
to
East
Hawkins
will
this
reach
Pennhurst
Of
course
Yeah
Why
are
we
talking
about
East
Hawkins
No
No
No
Max
Max
Seriously
Seriously
Im
not
joking
Im
not
driving
you
anywhere
If
you
think
Im
going
to
spend
what
is
likely
the
last
day
of
my
life
in
the
armpit
that
is
Mike
Wheelers
basement
youre
out
of
your
mind
Either
take
me
where
I
need
to
go
or
tie
me
down
which
is
technically
kidnapping
of
a
minor
And
if
I
live
to
see
another
day
Steve
I
swear
to
God
I
will
prosecute
Open
the
door
Uh
no
I
know
a
good
lawyer
Henderson
that
super
walkie
of
yours
better
reach
Pennhurst
I
cant
breathe
in
this
thing
and
Im
itchy
Im
itching
all
over
Its
not
all
about
comfort
Okay
Were
academics
Who
are
evidently
coming
straight
from
Easter
brunch
Also
this
bra
that
you
gave
me
is
really
pinching
my
boobs
Okay
Could
you
just
let
me
do
the
talking
If
thats
even
possible
Its
not
only
possible
its
inevitable
Because
shortly
Ill
be
dead
from
strangulation
GPAs
Both
of
you
Impressive
And
this
is
a
recommendation
from
ProfessorBrantley
Yeah
I
know
Larry
Quite
well
actually
Eh
you
know
what
they
say
Those
who
cant
do
teach
Uh
yes
yes
thats
actually
why
were
here
I
mean
we
can
only
learn
so
much
in
a
classroom
Mmm
And
Im
sympathetic
to
your
struggle
truly
But
there
is
a
protocol
to
visiting
a
patient
like
Victor
You
put
in
a
request
and
thenundergo
a
screening
process
at
which
point
the
board
will
make
a
decision
I
can
see
youre
disappointed
But
Im
more
than
happy
to
give
you
a
tour
Perhaps
you
can
even
speak
to
some
patients
in
our
lowsecurity
wing
And
wed
we
would
love
that
Its
just
that
um
our
thesis
is
due
next
month
And
youre
out
of
time
Whose
fault
is
that
Ours
Absolutely
And
I
do
apologize
Dont
apologize
Ruth
Screw
that
The
fact
is
we
did
put
in
a
request
months
ago
and
were
denied
And
then
we
reapplied
and
were
denied
again
And
coming
here
was
our
lastditch
effort
to
save
our
thesis
And
I
really
I
cant
breathe
in
this
thing
Well
Rose
maybe
youd
like
to
go
outside
and
get
some
air
Maybe
I
should
Ruth
Mmhmm
Because
Im
starting
to
think
this
whole
thing
is
a
colossal
mistake
Im
breaking
out
in
a
rash
My
boobs
hurt
And
Ill
tell
you
the
truth
Anthony
May
I
call
you
Anthony
These
arent
my
clothes
I
borrowed
them
because
I
wanted
you
to
take
us
seriously
Because
nobody
takes
girls
seriously
in
this
field
They
just
dont
We
dont
look
the
part
or
whatever
But
can
I
tell
you
a
story
I
was
at
summer
camp
And
my
counselor
Drew
told
me
and
everyone
in
Cabin
C
the
true
story
of
the
Victor
Creel
Massacre
And
littlePetey
McHew
You
know
Petey
right
Ruth
Of
Of
course
Yeah
Little
Petey
McHew
started
sobbing
right
there
on
the
spot
Fullon
hyperventilating
The
other
campers
couldnt
sleep
for
weeks
I
couldnt
either
but
not
cause
I
was
scared
Because
I
was
obsessed
with
the
question
What
would
drive
a
human
being
to
commit
such
unimaginable
acts
Other
kids
wanted
to
be
astronauts
basketball
players
rock
stars
But
I
wanted
to
be
you
I
wanted
to
be
you
So
forgive
me
if
Ill
now
try
anything
in
my
power
including
wearing
this
ridiculous
outfit
if
I
might
get
to
speak
to
the
man
that
ignited
my
passion
and
learn
a
little
more
about
how
his
twisted
but
lets
face
it
totally
fascinating
mind
works
So
yes
we
dont
have
the
official
paperwork
but
dont
tell
me
that
crybaby
Petey
McHew
wouldnt
have
gotten
an
audience
with
Victor
in
moments
if
hed
asked
politely
because
you
and
I
both
know
that
he
would
So
ten
minutes
with
Victor
Thats
all
I
ask
Im
back
in
Mmhmm
If
things
go
sideways
I
should
mention
Im
now
a
black
belt
in
karate
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

are
you
I
Uh
Were
looking
for
Yuri
Why

private
matter

pull
him
out
of
cockpit
and
kill
Yuri
No

bear
claws

Bradley

So
Im

catching
up
on
some
chores
Um
I
I
left
some
letters
inside
For
you
and
and
Granny
and
Uncle
Jack
And
Dad
If
you
can
find
him
Letters
I
I
dont
understand
Uh
I
just
um
With
all
the
murders
and
everything
I
I
know
its
stupid
but
I
just
started
to
think
What
if
something
happens
to
me
Max
baby
nothing
is
going
to
happen
to
you
I
know
But
if
if
it
did
I
just
Theres
so
many
things
that
I
want
to
say
that
I
need
to
say
And
Promise
youll
give
the
letters
out
Max
youre
scaring
me
Im
not
trying
to
scare
you
Is
something
going
on
No
Is
it
baby
No
No
youre
right
Im
sure
Ill
be
fine
Im
being
silly
Max
Oh
sweetie
Shh
Its
okay
Nothing
is
going
to
happen
baby
I
promise
Nothing
you
dont
deserve
Mom
let
go
of
me
Mom
Let
go
Maxine
You
think
some
letters
are
going
to
make
things
right
Youve
broken
everything
Billy
Your
time
is
almost
at
an
end
Let
go
Hey
that
was
longer
than
seconds
Hey
whoa
whoa
You
all
right
Im
fine
Just
drive
Did
something
happen
Can
we
please
just
go
These
are
our
gardens
Beautiful
arent
they
We
allow
them
two
hours
of
outside
time
a
day
Cant
they
just
escape
They
could
But
the
vast
majority
choose
to
be
here
They
like
it
here
This
is
one
of
our
more
popular
areas
The
listening
room
We
found
that
music
has
a
particularly
calming
effect
on
the
broken
mind
The
right
song
particularly
one
which
holds
some
personal
meaning
can
prove
a
salient
stimulus
But
there
are
those
who
are
beyond
a
cure
Uh
Dr
Hatch
do
you
think
it
might
be
possible
for
us
to
speak
to
Victor
alone
Alone
I
I
think
that
we
would
just
love
the
challenge
of
speaking
with
Victor
without
the
safety
net
of
an
expert
such
as
yourself
Then
we
could
really
rub
it
in
Professor
Bradleys
face
Professor
Bradley
I
dont
believe
I
know
a
Professor
Bradley
Brantley
She
she
meant
to
say
Brantley
Didnt
I
say
Brantley
What
did
I
say
Sorry
silly
me
Words
letters
Guess
Im
just
nervous
I
mean
excited
So
excited
to
speak
with
Victor
Preferably
as
she
said
alone
Yes
Why
not
Youve
caught
me
in
a
rebellious
mood
And
theres
something
rather
urgent
I
need
to
check
on
anyway
so
Sure
Keep
a
close
eye
on
them
Thank
you
so
much
Dr
Hatch
Thank
you
Do
not
startle
him
Do
not
touch
him
Do
not
pass
him
anything
Stand
five
feet
away
from
the
bars
at
all
times
Get
away
Is
that
clear
Yes
sir
Yes
sir
Victor
Todays
your
lucky
day
You
got
visitors
Real
pretty
ones
Must
be
in
one
of
his
moods
Have
fun
Victor
My
name
is
Nancy
Nancy
Wheeler
And
this
is
Robin
Buckley
Um
we
have
some
questions
I
dont
talk
to
reporters
Hatch
knows
that
Were
not
reporters
Were
here
because
we
believe
you
And
because
we
need
your
help
Whatever
killed
your
family
we
think
its

selfpitying
idiot

I

Does

make
sense
I

no
idea
whats
gonna

But

Antonov
phone
for
you
You

an
escape
They

urgent
Hello
Enzo
It
is
Yuri
Why
are
you
calling
me
here
Are
you
mad
I
know
I
am
very
sorry
I
just
felt
you
should
know
that
there
has
been
a
slight
change
in
plans
What
What
has
happened
I
just
got
off
the
phone
with
your
warden
A
very
productive
call
It
turns
out
escaped
prisoners
are
worth
quite
a
bit
of
money
So
Yuri
thinks
why
not
keep
the
forty
grand
and
make
extra
money
That
wasnt
the
deal
But
it
is
a
better
deal
for
Yuri
yes
And
you
know
what
is
worth
even
more
than
escaped
prisoner
Corrupt
guards
What
have
you
done
And
worth
most
of
all
Americans
wanted
by
the
KGB
Goodbye
Enzo
Im
sorry
poor
bird
Did
I

Okay

Wait

the
car
This
wont
be
long
When
he
attacks
our
friend
described
it
as
a
trance
Like
a
waking
nightmare
Thats
why
we
think
hes
coming
for
her
next
Does
any
of
this
anything
weve
told
you
sound
like
what
happened
to
your
family
Victor
I
know
this
is
hard
You
dont
know
anything
Youre
right
We
dont
know
Thats
why
were
here
To
learn
to
understand
We
need
to
know
how
you
survived
that
night
Survived
Is
that
what
you
call
this
Did
I
survive
No
I
assure
you
I
am
still
very
much
in
hell
I
had
been
back
from
the
war
some
years
Her
greatuncle
had
died
leaving
us
a
small
fortune
Enough
to
buy
a
new
home
a
new
life
Whatd
I
tell
ya
Wow
This
is
amazing
It
looks
like
afairy
tale
A
dream
Alice
no
running
Its
so
big
This
is
nice
Yeah
It
was
a
magnificent
home
Yeah
Alice
said
it
looked
like
it
was
from
a
fairy
tale
Alice
Was
this
your
daughter
Mmm
Yeah
But
Henry
my
My
boy
he
was
a
sensitive
child
and
I
could
see
he
felt
something
was
wrong
We
had
one
month
of
peace
in
that
house
And
then
it
began
Dead
animals
mutilated
tortured
began
to
appear
near
our
home
Rabbits
squirrels
chickens
even
dogs
The
police
chief
blamed
the
attacks
on
a
wildcat
This
this
was
no
wildcat
This
was
an
evil
And
evil
neither
animal
nor
human
This
was
a
spawn
of
Satan
A
demon
And
it
was
even
closer
than
I
realized
Victor
My
family
began
to
have
encounters
conjured
by
this
demon
Nightmares
Waking
living
nightmares
This
demon
it
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
tormenting
us
Even
poor
innocent
Alice
Alice
Its
okay
sweetie
Its
okay
Come
here
It
wasnt
long
before
I
began
to
have
encounters
of
my
own
I
suppose
all
evil
must
have
a
home
And
though
I
had
not
a
rational
explanation
for
it
I
I
could
sense
this
demon
always
close
I
became
convinced
it
was
hiding
nesting
somewhere
within
the
shadows
of
our
home
It
had
cursed
our
town
It
had
cursed
our
home
It
had
cursed
us
Stars
shining
bright
above
you
Night
breezes
seem
to
whisper
Time
weather
and
Dream
a
little
dream
of
It
took
Virginia
first
Just
hold
me
tight
And
tell
me
youll
miss
me
I
tried
to
get
the
children
out
to
save
them
Come
on
Come
on
Creel
Creel
What
the
hell
happened
here
But
I
was
back
to
France
back
in
the
war
It
it
was
a
memory
I
had
thought
German
soldiers
were
inside
I
ordered
its
shelling
I
was
wrong
This
demon
it
was
taunting
me
And
I
was
sure
it
would
take
me
just
as
hed
taken
my
Virginia
But
then
I
heard
another
voice
Stars
shining
bright
above
you
At
first
I
believed
it
was
an
angel
And
I
I
followed
her
only
to
find
myself
in
a
nightmare
far
worse
While
I
was
away
the
demon
took
my
children
Henry
slipped
into
a
coma
shortly
after
that
A
week
later
he
died
I
tried
to
join
them
I
tried
Hatch
stopped
the
bleeding
He
wouldnt
let
me
join
them
The
angel
you
followed
who
was
she
Victor
Victor
Is
he
everything
you
hoped
he
would
be
I
just
had
a
very
interesting
conversation
with
ProfessorBrantley
Perhaps
we
should
discuss
in
my
office
while
we
wait
for
the
police
Dear
Billy
I
dont
know
if
you
can
even
hear
this
Two
years
ago
I
would
have
said
Thats
ridiculous
impossible
But
that
was
before
I
found
out
about
alternate
dimensions
and
monsters
so
Im
just
going
to
stop
assuming
that
I
know
anything
So
much
has
happened
since
you
left
Your
dad
was
a
total
mess
He
and
my
mom
started
getting
into
fights
Bad
fights
I
dont
think
he
could
stand
being
here
without
you
So
he
left
And
he
didnt
leave
Mom
much
Shes
taken
an
extra
job
and
we
moved
to
that
lovely
trailer
park
off
Kerley
Basically
ever
since
you
left
everythings
been
A
total
disaster
And
the
worst
part
is
I
cant
tell
anyone
why
youre
gone
I
cant
tell
them
that
you
saved
Els
life
That
you
saved
my
life
I
play
that
moment
back
in
my
head
all
the
time
And
sometimes
I
imagine
myself
running
to
you
pulling
you
away
I
imagine
that
if
I
had
that
you
would
still
be
here
And
everything
would
be
everything
would
be
right
again
I
imagine
that
we
That
we
couldve
become
friends
Good
friends
like
like
a
real
brother
and
sister
And
I
know
thats
stupid
You
hated
me
I
hated
you
But
I
thought
that
maybe
Maybe
we
could
try
again
But
thats
not
what
happened
I
just
I
stood
there
and
I
watched
For
a
while
I
tried
to
be
happy
Normal
But
I
I
think
that
maybe
a
part
of
me
died
that
day
too
And
I
havent
told
anyone
this
I
I
just
cant
But
I
had
to
tell
you
Before
its
too
late
If
you
can
even
hear
this
I
really
hope
that
you
can
Im
sorry
Im
so
so
sorry
Billy

your
shitty
little
sister

Max
You

I
think
theres
a
part
of
you
buried
somewhere
deep
that
wanted
me
to
die
that
day
That
was
maybe
even
relieved
Happy
Billy

such
guilt

Why

hide
from
your
friends
Why

from
the
world
No
No
And
why

at
night
you
have
sometimes
wished
to
follow
me
Follow
me
into
death
That
is
why
I
am
here
Max

To

your
suffering

You

Victor
said
the
night
of
the
attack
everything
went
on
in
the
house
but
he
made
specific
mention
of
music
He
said
music
was
playing
And
then
when
we
asked
him
about
the
angel
he
started
to
hum
Say
nightynight
and
kiss
me
Hold
me
tight
Dream
a
Little
Dream
of
Me
Ella
Fitzgerald
The
voice
of
an
angel
Yeah
Hatch
said
that
music
can
reach
parts
of
the
brain
that
words
cant
So
maybe
thats
the
key
a
lifeline
A
lifeline
back
to
reality
Its
worth
a
shot
I
think
we
can
beat
him

To

it
out
than
to
explain
it

Not
so
much
Is
that
It
was
like
they
were
on
display
And
then
there
was
this
red
fog
everywhere
It
was
like
a
dream
A
nightmare
You
think
Vecnas
just
trying
to
scare
you
With
Billy

But
when
I
made
it
here
I
dunno
something

different
He
seemed
surprised
almost
Like
he
didnt
want
me
there
Maybe
you
infiltrated
his
mind
He
invaded
your
mind

Is
it
that
big
a
leap

Kruegers
boiler
room
Freddie
Krueger
Hes
a
super
burnedup
dude
with
razors
for
fingers
And
he

you
in
your
dreams
Seriously
Sorry

movie
Its
not
real
Just
think
about
it
What
if
you
somehow
unlocked
a
backdoor
to
Vecnas
world

the
answer
were
looking
for
is
somewhere
in
this
incredibly
vague
drawing
God

know
Having
families
And
then
things
started
going
wrong
Kids
born
stillborn
Dead
in
the
womb
Crooked
spines
eyes
popped
out
The
horror
Followed
us
clung
to
us
My
wife
Diane
she
wanted
a
baby
I
did
too
We
had
a
baby
and
she
was
um
She
was
born
healthy
She
was
perfect
you
know
Sara
And
then
she
died
Blood
pressures
dropping
It
wasnt
an
easy
death
She
Suffered
I
knew
the
risks
but
I
um
I
hid
them
And
then
Diane
left
me
She
didnt
blame
me
Not
with
words
After
that
I
was
just
I
just
hid
myself
in
drugs
and
alcohol
And
then
people
started
coming
into
my
life
This
girl
El
and
Joyce
just
happened
and
I
told
myself
they
needed
me
But
that
wasnt
true
Thats
a
lie
They
didnt
need
me
I
needed
them
I
needed
them
You
were
right
what
you
said
last
night
I
knew
the
risks
breaking
out
of
here
but
I
did
it
anyway
The
minute
I
sent
for
Joyce
the
minute
I
sent
for
her
I
sentenced
her
to
death
Just
like
I
did
with
Sara
Everyone
I
love
I
hurt
See
I
was
wrong
this
whole
time
I
wasnt
cursed
I
am
the
curse
Ive
heard
rumors
of
a
monster
From
America
I
dont
know
if
what
you
say
is
true
American
if
youre
truly
a
cursed
man
but
youre
right
about
one
thing
We
are
going
to
die
in
here
Can
I
help
you
We
need
to
look
around
Yep
I
think
its
some
kind
of
leak
I
havent
had
a
chance
to
fix
it
with
everything
going
on
Pack
your
things
Were
moving
you
The
devil
is
here
I
can
feel
his
presence
Growing
stronger
each
day
But
I
know
Chrissys
in
heaven
now
looking
down
at
us
smiling
Happy
to
see
all
the
lives
she
touched
and
brightened
But
I
also
know
shes
frustrated
Angry
That
the
monster
that
did
this
to
her
is
still
out
there
Still
Hurting
others
How
can
he
live
while
my
angel
is
gone
I
know
God
has
a
plan
Lord
Ive
prayed
And
I
just
do
not
understand
it
I
see
no
reason
I
see
no
reason
So
I
finally
got
a
hold
of
Cappelletti
Photos
for
the
yearbook
Hot
damn
Sinclair
Goddamn
traitor
Only
reason
hed
lead
us
to
a
dead
end
The
Hellfire
Club
Theyre
hiding
Eddie
Maybe
we
should
bring
this
to
the
cops
The
cops
who
think
Chrissys
a
drug
dealer
Who
are
letting
this
this
psycho
go
around
killing
people
Im
just
saying
what
if
this
cult
is
doing
shit
to
us
Doing
what
They
already
know
were
after
them
What
if
they
cursed
us
or
some
shit
Patrick
thinks
hes
cursed
Hey
None
of
this
is
funny
Look
I
dont
believe
in
that
supernatural
crap
all
right
But
this
cult
is
dangerous
We
have
to
be
smart
about
this
I
made
a
list
Everywhere
these
freaks
have
been
seen
We
divide
and
conquer
Check
em
out
one
by
one
Smoke
em
out
We
should
add
Reefer
Ricks
house
to
this
What
Reefer
Rick
Hes
Eddies
supplier
Hes
supposed
to
be
in
prison
but
someone
spotted
him
back
in
his
house
Now
my
parents
are
freaking
out
and
shit
Its
probably
nothing
I
dont
know
No
thats
good
Thats
good
No
stones
unturned
Yeah
thats
not
creepy
What
exactly
are
we
supposed
to
be
looking
for
in
this
shithole
Were
not
sure
We
just
know
this
house
is
important
to
Vecna
Because
Max
saw
it
in
Vecnas
red
soup
mind
world
Basically
Great
Maybe
it
holds
a
clue
to
where
Vecna
is
Why
hes
back
Why
he
killed
the
Creels
And
how
to
stop
him
before
he
comes
back
for
Max
We
dont
think
hes
in
here
do
we
Guess
well
find
out
Ready
Mmhmm
Max
What
are
you
doing
in
here
Max
Its
locked
Should
I
knock
see
if
anybodys

a
key
Looks

their
electric
bill

you
need
to
be
told
everything
Youre
not
a
child
Thank

Huh
Back

I
guess
a
triple
homicide
isnt
good
for
resale
value
Hey

that
right
Yeah
Yeah
Is
this
what
you
saw
In
your
visions
I
mean
its
just
a
clock
Right
Like
a
normal
old
clock
Why
is
this
wizard
obsessed
with
clocks
Maybe
hes
like
a
clockmaker
or
something
I
think
you
cracked
the
case

Nina

traumatized

memory
It

Every

would
return
to
the
train
station
to
await
her
lovers
return
A
return

If

The

nobody
by
any

ever
observes
Sherlock
Holmes
Thats

Or
Do
Dont

Or
Sherlock
Holmes

All

In

I
bet
if

combo
we

open
a
door
to
his
secret
lair
Voilà

it
stop
gasping
I
can
make
the
pain
end
Wheres
the
girl
weakly
I
told
you
I
dont
I
dont
I
dont
know
There
are
two
proposed
explanations
for
what
is
happening
Explanation
one
an
invisibleboogeyman
from
another
dimension
is
slaughtering
these
kids
Explanation
two
Dr
Brenners
special
little
pet
has
gone
rogue
again
and
he
and
his
lackeys
are
now
seeking
to
cover
it
up
Perhaps
in
the
hopes
of
selling
their
pet
to
the
Soviets
Now
which
explanation
sounds
plausible
to
you
Hmm
sobs
I
dont
know
Theres
still
a
chance
to
redeem
yourself
Mr
Wallace
Where
is

Brenner
Do
you
know
what
happens
when
someone
has
a
stroke
The
blood
supply
to
the
brain
is
cut
off
It
scrambles
the
signals
in
the
brain
to
the
point
where
the
mind
can
forget
how
to
do
things
To
eat
To
speak
To
walk
When
you
were
attacked
last
year
I
believe
that
your
signals
were
scrambled
in
much
the
same
way
mysterious
music
playing
But
just
as
a
stroke
victim
can
learn
to
walk
again
I
believe
you
too
can
return
to
your
full
power
Your
abilities
are
still
in
here
You
just
need
to
remember
beeping
Everything
that
took
place
in
my
lab
was
captured
on
videotape
Every
success
and
every
failure
Its
important
for
you
to
not
just
see
your
past
but
to
fully
reexperience
it
In
doing
so
I
believe
we
can
repair
your
broken
signals
As
we
saw
tonight
that
process
has
already
begun
player
whirring
If
this
all
happened
why
dont
I
remember
Because
you
do
not
want
to
Our
brains
have
a
defense
mechanism
in
place
to
protect
it
from
bad
memories
From
trauma
You
buried
these
memories
long
ago
Eleven
Papa
When
I
was
in
there
I
saw
something
eerie
distorted
audio
There
was
blood
sinister
music
playing
So
much
blood
That
was
another
memory
a
a
more
powerful
one
invading
from
your
subconscious
You
have
demons
Eleven
You
have
demons
in
your
past
That
is
why
we
must
proceed
carefully
One
step
at
a
time
one
memory
at
a
time
mysterious
music
playing
If
we
go
too
fast
Im
afraid
you
could
become
lost
in
the
darkness
tank
door
whirring
And
if
you
are
lost
So
are
we
all
disconcerting
audio
distortion
mysterious
music
continues
mysterious
music

indistinct

Oh
Hey
Eric
Im
taking
five
You
just
took
five
Yeah
well
tell
Milo
to
take
it
easy
on
the
onions
next

laughs
upbeat
music

on

Robin
Not
to
be
a
wimp
but
can
I
sit
in
the
car
Cause
this
is
gonna
totally
and
royally
suck
Itll
be
fine
I
cant
stand
to
see
those
dull
eyes
of
Eddies
break
again
I
really
really
cant
At
least
he
can
drink
himself
into
feeling
better
Thats
what
my
mom
does
Robin
Why
dont
we
give
it
a
trial
Hey
Eddie
Uh
good
news
first
this
time
We
got
you
some
Dustinapproved
junk
food
and
that
sixpack
you
requested
Oh
yeah
and
we
found
Vecna
Bad
news
is
that
hes
in
that
other
darker
much
scarier
dimension
and
the
gates
closed
so
we
have
no
way
of
getting
to
him
Hes
entirely
shut
off
to
us
so
basically
youre
screwed
And
no
I
know
you
were
already
screwed
but
now
youre
doubly
triply
screwed
Wait
Maybe
we
dont
put
it
like
that
Were
one
step
closer
to
finding
Vecna
Thats
what
we
say
Thats
whats
important
See
Robin
Positive
spin
can
make
all
the
difference
Uhhuh
Oh

Powell
Nothing

Just

All

This

Powell
As
many
of

the
Roane
County
line
received
a
call
a
little
after
midnight
indistinct
chatter
reporting
a
homicide
here
on
the
lake
Officer
Callahan
here
and
myself
arrived
first
on
the
scene
We
made
our
way
to
the
shore
of
Lovers
Lake
about
ten
yards
from
that
house
you

behind
me
It
was
there
that

seniorfrom
Hawkins

was
an
eyewitness
on
the
scene
Thats
what
I
want
to
know
We
got
a
serial
killer
on
the
loose
We
have
also
identified
a
person
of
interest
Eddie
Munson

anyone

We

What
are
you
talking
about
Fight
I
have
been
in
this
place
one
week
ominous
music
playing
My
first
night
I
saw
six
men
enter
this
room
Six
Just
like
us
They
came
out
happy
and
fat
faces
smothered
in
grease
ominous
music
continues
But
when
night
fell
they
were
thrown
into
that
pit
out
there
But
not
alone
You
heard
those
roars
yes
That
is
a
monster
Not
from
this
world
intense
stinger
plays
Hopper
grunting
Thirty
seconds
it
took
Thirty
seconds
And
all
six
men
You
speak
no
sense
If
they
plan
to
kill
us
tonight
why
waste
this
food
on
us
They
want
us
strong
So
we
can
fight
it
To
test
its
strength
To
train
this
monster
for
war
But
last
week
the
men
got
their
weapons
then
scattered
like
fools
We
stick
together
Perhaps
we
stand
a
chance
Perhaps
we
live
to
see
another
day
all
Till
tomorrow
music
builds
to

Let

Thin

Ive

You

Because
if

eerie

I
spent
years
with
One
Right
here
In
this
very
room
Where
is
he
Maybe
well
save
that
story
for
another
day
It
doesnt
have
a
happy
ending
Im
afraid
But
he
was
a
lot
like
you
Everything
was
hard
for
him
Then
out
of
nowhere
he
walked
in
here
and
it
was
like
something
had
changed
And
I
asked
him
whats
different
and
he
said
He
said
he
had
figured
it
out
He
had
found
his
strength
in
a
memory
from
his
past
Something
that
made
him
sad
But
also
angry
Do
you
maybe
have
a
memory
like
that
Do
you
remember
the
day
a
strange
woman
came
to
see
you
This

doesnt

And
the
people
here
Are
not
what
you
think

Good
morning
children
children
Good
morning
Papa
Ive
got
something
very
special
planned
for
you
today
Are
you

Yes
Papa
Good
Seventeen
would
you
open
the
door
Yes
Papa
Off
you

After

We

just
told
her
the

And

No
Shell

out
soon

Steve
Dude
Im
telling
you
youre
taking
us
the
wrong
way
Its
north
Im
positive
I
checked
the
map
You
do
realize
Skull
Rock
its
a
super
popular
makeout
spot
Yeah
So
Yeah
well
it
wasnt
popular
until
I
made
it
popular
All
right
I
practically
invented
it
Were
heading
in
the
wrong
direction
Steve
Where
are
you
going
Steve
Stop
whining
Lets
go
Trust
me
Max
Okay
so
apparently
were
going
this
way
now
I
swear
to
God
if
they
get
us
lost
Hey
You
okay
Uh
yeah
Im
fine
Just
Thinking
about
Patrick
You
know
Yeah
I
mean
its
its
like
why
him
But
then
I
remember
this
one
day
he
he
came
to
practice
with
a
black
eye
He
said
he
fell
but
clearly
he
was
lying
Its
like
everyone
Vecna
targets
has
something
in
their
life
Something
thats
Hurting
them
Haunting
them
eerie
music
playing
Yeah
I
I
didnt
really
know
Patrick
so
it
was
easy
to
just
look
the
other
way
I
guess
But
I
did
know
you
And
Im
sorry
I
wasnt
there
Its
not
your
fault
No
I
disappeared
No
no
you
didnt
I
just
didnt
look
hard
enough
Okay
But
I
see
you
now
I
see
you
scoffs
Oh
my
God
theyre
so
adorable
I
just
wanna
squeeze
em
you
know
If
Im
permitted
to
see
a
silver
lining
in
this
endoftheworld
doom
and
gloom
it
would
be
the
rekindling
of
old
flames
that
never
shouldve
been
snuffed
out
I
didnt
mean
that
as
a
hint
or
anything
Right
But
if
I
did
mean
it
as
a
hint
would
that
be
so
terrible
To
wish
for
happiness
for
my
friends
scoffs
You
think
Im
not
happy
I
Im
sure
you
are
Its
just
the
other
day
I
mentioned
Jonathan
and
you
flinched
or
winced
or
something
like
I
didnt
flinch
or
wince
Okay
Jonathan
and
I
are
fine
Got
it
Were
good
Right
Its
just
Nancy
sighs
emotional
music
playing
He
was
supposed
to
be
here
for
the
break
and
then
he
backed
out
at
the
last
minute
for
some
vague
mumbly
Jonathan
reason
And
to
be
honest
Im
not
that
surprised
because
Ive
been
feeling
him
pulling
away
And
I
dont
know
if
its
because
were
miles
away
or
if
he
met
someone
new
or
what
And
now
I
cant
find
out
why
because
apparently
hes
blown
up
his
familys
house
phone
or
something
So
yeah
if
if
the
mention
of
his
name
caused
a
slight
muscle
spasm
on
my
face
thats
probably
why
Seems
like
a
perfectly
reasonable
reason
to
flinch
wince
or
something
You
said
the
happiness
of
your
friends
So
does
that
make
us
friends
As
in
officially
Uh
yeah
I
I
mean
right
Right
Steve
Oh
boom
Bada
bing
bada
boom
There
she
is
Henderson
Skull
Rock
In
your
face
man
In
your
stupid
cocky
little
face
Doesnt
make
sense
Yeah
yeah
Even
with
it
staring
you
in
the
face
you
cant
admit
it
Cant
admit
youre
wrong
you
butthead
Eddie
I
concur
You
Dustin
Henderson
are
a
Total
butthead
Jesus
we
thought
you
were
a
goner
Yeah
me
too
man
Me
too
How
long
have
you
known
Eddie
was
killing
these
kids
It
was
his
trailer
where
Chrissy
was
killed
and
you
expect
us
to
believe
he
was
made
a
suspect
just
this
morning
The
truth
is
weve
been
following
several
leads
and
yes
Eddie
Munson
was
one
of
them
And
we
are
now
doing
everything
in
our
power
to
find
him
all
clamoring
Powell
In
the
meantime
for
your
safety
we
will
be
enforcing
a
strict
curfew
What
Thats
your
solution
Hide
from
him
Were
already
doing
that
Its
been
days
Days
So
you
tell
me
why
hes
not
behind
bars
right
now
I
understand
you
all
are
upset
but
I
promise
you
we
will
find
him
Jason
No
crowd
falls
silent
You
wont
Jason
Son
how
about
we
talk
about
this
in
private
Why
So
you
can
keep
me
quiet
So
you
can
keep
the
truth
from
coming
out
I
dont
know
about
the
rest
of
you
but
I
cant
bear
to
listen
to
any
more
excuses
and
lies
Thats
enough
I
agree
Ive
had
enough
scattered
yelling
In
fact
I
think
weve
all
had
enough
applause
microphone
feedback
Last
night
unsettling
music
playing
Last
night
I
saw
things
things
I
cant
explain
Things
the
police
dont
wanna
believe
And
things
that
I
dont
wanna
believe
myself
But
I
know
what
I
saw
I
know
And
Ive
come
to
accept
an
awful
truth
These
murders
are
ritualistic
sacrifices
crowd
gasping
Weve
all
heard
how
satanic
cults
are
spreading
through
our
country
like
some
some
disease
And
Eddie
Munson
is
the
leader
of
one
of
these
cults
A
cult
that
operates
here
in
Hawkins
The
mall
fire
All
those
unexplained
deaths
over
the
years
Some
people
say
our
town
is
cursed
They
just
dont
know
why
Now
Now
we
do
Now
we
know
They
call
themselves
Hellfire
Thats
bullshit
The
Hellfire
isnt
a
cult
Its
a
club
for
nerds
Mrs
Sinclair
Erica
Just
the
facts
Jason
A
club
A
club
A
harmless
club
Thats
what
they
want
you
to
think
But
its
a
lie
A
lie
designed
to
conceal
the
truth
breathes
shakily
And
now
this
cult
is
protecting
its
leader
Eddie
Hiding
him
Allowing
him
to
to
continue
his
rampage
Last
night
I
became
overcome
with
this
feeling
of
of
hopelessness
Then
I
remembered
Romans
Do
not
be
overcome
by
evil
But
overcome
evil
with
good
And
God
knows
theres
good
in
this
town
So
much
good
Its
in
this
room
Its
in
this
room
right
here
right
now
So
I
came
here
today
humbly
to
ask
for
your
help
To
join
me
in
this
fight
Let
us
cast
out
this
evil
and
save
Hawkins
together
crowd
murmurs
quietly
crowd
shifts
uneasily
What
are
yall
just
sitting
around
for
You
heard
the
kid
ominous
music
playing
Powell
Hey
I
want
you
all
to
hear
me
loud
and
clear
on
this
Anyone
interfering
with
this
investigation
will
be
arrested
Hey
Hey
We
will
be
implementing
a
curfew
If
you
are
not
in
your
house
after
sunset
with
the
doors
locked
youll
be
written
up
And
its
gonna
go
on
your
permanent
record
Suzie
Okay
that
is
a
lot
to
process
I
mean
that
might
be
seriously
the
craziest
thing
Ive
ever
heard
I
know
its
hard
to
believe
But
its
true
All
true
I
dial
in
to
this
computer
and
find
a
location
and
at
this
location
is
the
Nina
Project
Exactly
And
the
Nina
Project
is
the
code
name
for
a
video
game
No
its
not
just
a
video
game
Its
a
video
game
console
Its
basically
Americas
answer
to
Nintendo
Americantendo
Thats
a
stupid
name
Youre
right
it
is
a
stupid
name
but
Suzie
its
bit
Sixteenbit
Why
have
I
never
heard
of
it
Because
its
top
secret
Thats
why
were
doing
this
Yeah
right
Its
for
the
promotion
The
first
people
to
find
the
secret
location
receive
a
Americantendo
Uh
an
Americantendo
So
you
drove
miles
over
your
spring
break
so
I
can
help
you
get
a
new
video
game
console
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
all
Yes
scoffs
But
its
not
for
us
Its
for
Dustin
Right
Exactly
Its
for
Dustin
For
Dustins

which
is
In
two

five

I
dont

Pull

synth
music

Okay
so
can
you
help
I
would
do
anything
for
Dustybun
but
Im
afraid
theres
been
an
unfortunate
development
After
changing
Dustys
grade
I
was
wracked
with
the
most
awful
guilt
Suzie
I
am
incredibly
disappointed
Father
could
see
my
soul
was
tortured
and
he
wrenched
a
confession
out
of
me
I
wanted
to
help
him
Not
only
was
I
breaking
the
law
I
was
dating
an
agnostic
An
agnostic
Ive
never
seen
Father
so
angry
starting
today
He
needed
me
Naturally
Father
no
after
learning
the
terrible
truth
he
confiscated
my
computer
And
Father
is
not
one
to
change
his
mind
Im
as
likely
to
see
it
again
as
I
am
my
poor
Dustybun
Where
is
it
His
study
He
uses
it
for
work
now
And
Fathers
always
working
and
his
door
is
like
permanently
locked
Will
scoffs
Im
really
sorry
Truly
But
it
looks
like
you
came
all
the
way
here
for
nothing

Unless
Unless
There
might
be
a

But
were
gonna
need
help
And
I

lot
of

All
right
tense
music
continues
Guys
Are
you
down
here
Guys
pants
They
shouldve
been
back
by
now
They
should
be
back
What
time
was
the
movie
Uh
four
hours
ago
Hate
to
break
it
to
you
Mrs
Wheeler
but
they
lied
to
you
Liar
liar
pants
on
fire
Holly
We
dont
think
theyre
actually
involved
with
Eddie
do
we
I
think
at
this
point
anythings
possible
Our
children
are
not
murderers
Ted
Dont
put
words
in
my
mouth
See
she
does
that
twists
my
words
Youre
calling
the
theater
keypad
beeping
inhales
The
police
line
ringing
When
I
got
to
the
shore
I
tried
calling
you
guys
but
uh
My
walkie
was
busted
man
Drenched
So
uh
I
did
the
thing
that
I
do
now
apparently
I
ran
chuckles
Do
you
know
what
time
this
was
The
attack
Yeah
no
I
I
know
exactly
what
time
it
was
My
walkie
wasnt
the
only
thing
that
got
soaked
Same
time
our
flashlights
went
kablooey
Which
means
what
exactly
That
that
surge
of
energy
was
Vecna
attacking
Patrick
Robin
Well
were
one
step
closer
We
know
how
Vecna
attacks
And
where
he
attacks
from
So
now
we
just
need
to
sneak
into
his
lair
in
the
Upside
Down
and
drive
a
stake
through
his
heart
If
he
has
a
heart
A
stake
Is
he
like
a
vamp
Is
he
a
vampire
It
was
a
metaphor
A
bullet
should
work
on
him
right
I
say
we
chop
his
head
off
All
of
the
above
but
we
cant
do
any
of
that
til
we
find
a
way
into
the
Upside
Down
We
need
El
to
get
her
powers
back
Everything
was
way
easier
We
had
this
girl
She
had
superpowers
Superpowers
Yeah
you
mentioned
her
Hey
uh
Hendersons
not
uh
cursed
is
he

No

Hes

I

Skull

Seriously
Youre
serious
Mmhmm
This
is
Skull
RockOkay
Mmhmm
Youre
totally
absolutely
wrong
Right
now
Yes
And
no
Oh
my
God
This
worked
correctly
when
we
left
the
Wheelers
Correct
when
we
got
in
the
car
on
Curly
But
it
started
to
slip
the
further
east
we
went
Now
its
way
off
When
I
was
leading
us
here
I
wasnt
wrong
The
compass
was
So
youre
using
faulty
equipment
Youre
still
wrong
Except
it
isnt
faulty
Lucas
remember
what
can
affect
a
compass
An
electromagnetic
field
Yep
Sorry
I
mustve
skipped
that
class
In
the
presence
of
a
stronger
electromagnetic
field
the
needle
will
deflect
towards
that
power
So
either
theres
some
super
big
magnet
around
here
or
Theres
a
gate
But
were
nowhere
near
the
lab
But
what
if
somehow
theres
another
gate
A
gate
that
we
dont
know
about
Itd
have
to
be
smaller
Way
less
powerful
Snacksize
gate
How
Why
No
idea
All
I
know
is
that
something
is
causing
this
disturbance
and
the
last
time
weve
seen
anything
like
it
it
was
a
gate
And
I
hope
it
is
because
then
wed
have
a
way
to
Vecna
And
a
shot
at
freeing
Max
from
this
curse
Steve
Where
are
you
going
Hey
hey
hey
hey
hey
Eddies
still
a
wanted
man
We
cant
just
go
hike
in
the
woods
This
little
steel
capsule
might
be
the
key
to
saving
both
Max
and
Eddie
What
say
you
Eddie
the
Banished
mysterious
music
trails
off
I
say
youre
asking
me
to
follow
you
into
Mordor
which
if
Im
totally
straight
with
you
I
think
is
a
really
bad
idea
But
uh
the
Shire
The
Shire
is
burning

So
Mordor

What

If
you
allow

Between

Approximately

I

Because
its
not
on
the
map
but
it
is
there
How
do
we
know
youre
not
leading
us
into
some
trap
Because
I
do
not
need
to
You
want
to
break
into
deadliest
prison
in
all
motherland

It
is

Who
said
anything
about

Oh
You

Oh

Im

Something

yes
Murray
You
were
planning
to
turn
us
over
to
the
warden
Today
if
Im
not
mistaken
Ah
I
see
now
I
bring
you
in
as
prisoners
and
then
set
you
free
inside
walls
It
is
risky
crazy
you
will
still
probably
die
yet
I
like
it
But
for
this
to
work
Yuri
cannot
be
tied
Hey
its
hard
to
turn
over
prisoners
when
Im
a
prisoner
myself
Hey
I
think
the
warden
might
find
that
suspicious
Which
is
why
from
here
on
out
youre
gonna
be
Murray
And
Im
gonna
be
Yuri
I
dont
follow
Dont
worry
Its
a
silent

You
want
to
make
a

of
yourself
go

But
to
bring
down
these

leaving
them
with
no
hope
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
I
tell
them
truth
You
feed
their
delusion
Not
delusions
Hope
I
believe
we
can
fight
I
believe
we
can
win
I
have
a
son
Mikhail
I
cannot
leave
this
world
with
him
believing
his
father
is
a
traitor
I
need
to
get
back
to
him
and
I
will
get
back
to
him
Is
he
slow
What
Mikhail
your
son
Is
Is
he
slow
Is
he
stupid
in

Stop
talking
in
English
No
hes
very
smart
Top
of
his
class
in

Be
silent
in

Then
youre
not
his
father
in
Russian
I
said
go
in
English
You
are
drunk
American
I
would
stop
speaking
unless
you
wish
to
die
sooner
I
can
It
doesnt
matter
I
know
Im
gonna
die
today
But
guess
what
I
know
who
I
am
and
what
Ive
done
unlike
you
and
these
men
who
cant
face
the
truth
That
youre
the
reason
why
were
in
here
Youre
gonna
die
in
Russian
Come
on
go
in

Your
son
is
not

Were
running
out
of
time
here
Martin
Hawkins
is
running
out
of
time
I
understand
the
stakes
quite
well
Sometimes
I
wonder
if
you
really
do
Or
maybe
youve
just
done
all
this
cause
you
missed
your
daddydaughter
time
Ive
given
you
everything
you
asked
for
Ive
compromised
my
principles
Ive
risked
my
life
my
familys
life
All
because
you
assured
me
this
would
work
that
this
was
the
only
way
But
I
dont
see
any
progress
out
there
Martin
You
know
what
I
see
I
see
a
frightened
traumatized
little
girl
Good
for
us
The
truth
is
youre
regressing
Eleven
Youre
going
backwards
Eleven
look
at
me
Look
at
me
I
know
youre
frightened
Youre
terribly
frightened
by
what
youve
seen
But
its
this
very
fear
thats
now
holding
you
back
If
you
want
Nina
to
succeed
you
cannot
hide
from
the
truth
no
matter
how
frightening
it
may
be
I
saw
what
I
did
I
am
a
monster
You
speak
of
monsters
superheroes
Thats
the
stuff
of
myth
and
fairy
tales
Reality
truth
is
rarely
so
simple
People
are
not
so
easily
defined
Only
by
facing
all
of
ourselves
the
good
and
the
bad
can
we
become
whole
What
if
I
dont
wanna
become
whole
Then
that
is
a
choice
Your
choice
The
door
is
always
open
This
place
is
not
a
prison
This
is
You
chose
to
trust
me
once
Im
asking
you
to
trust
me
again
Journey
with
me
into
the
past
one
last
time
Stop
hiding
Eleven
What
have
you
done
How
much
time
did
you
skip
You
wanted
progress
Im
giving
it
to
you
What
exactly
were
you
all
doing
at
the
lake
Uh
Its
comp
We
were
We
were
just
going
for
a
walk
A
walk
At
pm
To
the
lake
We
were
gonna
take
a
little
swim
Little
night
swim
Dusty
Someone
was
just
murdered
there
Yeah
we
we
didnt
realize
that
until
we
got
there
Thats
why
we
didnt
swim
And
Nancy
was
she
with
you
at
this
night
swim
No
Yes
Uh
Were
not
sure
She
was
there
Then
she
left
Its
all
a
little
confusing
Thats
when
you
guys
came
Right
Then
they
dared
me
to
say
what
I
said
Oh
yeah
About
the
killer
Youre
lucky
you
didnt
get
shot
Have
you
had
any
contact
with
Eddie
That
psycho
freak
killer
God
no
Nope
Absolutely
not
No
We
havent
heard
from
him
We
barely
know
the
guy
Who
Oh
thats
a
bunch
of
bull
Erica
I
mean
you
realize
theyre
lying
The
whole
couch
is
on
fire
Erica
Just
the
facts
Are
you
lying
to
these
policemen
Dusty
No
Lying
to
cops
is
a
crime
son
Im
not
lying
The
fire
is
consuming
us
Threaten
them
with
a
little
jail
time
Maybe
thatll
loosen
their
lips
Okay
You
wanna
send
our
kids
to
jail
We
need
to
take
this
seriously
He
didnt
mean
it
like
that
Shut
up
Oh
my
God
Shut
up
Jesus
Shh
Were
gonna
try
a
more
civilized
approach
One
at
a
time
You
first
Wait
what
Why
me
Follow
me
Im
not
even
in
Hellfire
Do
I
need
to
cuff
you
Up
Chopchop
Lets
go
Oh
okay
That
was
close
Yeah
Too
close
Oh
sh
shit
Steve
Jesus
Im
fine
Im
fine
No
no
no
Youre
not
Youre
losing
blood
Come
on
sit
All
right
All
right
Oh
Okay
So
the
good
news
is
Im
pretty
sure
wooziness
is
not
a
symptom
of
rabies
But
if
you
start
having
hallucinations
or
muscle
spasms
or
you
start
feeling
aggressive
like
you
wanna
punch
me
let
me
know
Robin
Yeah
I
kinda
wanna
punch
you
Sense
of
humors
still
intact
Thats
a
good
sign
Yeah
Okay
Okay
You
ready
Yeah
Just
do
it
Sorry
Its
okay
Too
tight
No
thats
good
All
right
Okay
Thanks
Yeah
So
uh
this
place
is
like
Hawkins
but
with
monsters
and
nasty
shit
Pretty
much
Wait
watch
out
for
the
vines
Its
all
a
hive
mind
Its
all
a
what
All
the
creepy
crawlies
around
here
Theyre
like
one
or
something
Step
on
a
vine
youre
stepping
on
a
bat
youre
stepping
on
Vecna
Shit
But
everything
from
our
world
is
still
here
right
Except
people
As
far
as
I
understand
it
yeah
So
theoretically
we
could
go
to
the
police
station
and
steal
guns
and
grenades
and
whatever
we
need
to
blow
up
those
bat
things
that
are
guarding
the
gate
I
highly
doubt
the
Hawkins
PD
has
grenades
Robin
But
guns
yeah
sure
Well
we
dont
have
to
go
all
the
way
downtown
for
guns
I
have
guns
in
my
bedroom
You
Nancy
Wheeler
have
guns
plural
in
your
bedroom
Full
of
surprises
isnt
she
A
Russian
Makarov
and
a
revolver
Yeah
you
almost
shot
me
with
that
one
You
almost
deserved
it
For
your
modesty
dude
Oh
my
god
So
guns
seem
like
a
pretty
good
idea
to
me
Yeah
me
too
So
what
are
we
waiting
for
You
know
what
we
are
to
attempt
is
quite
mad
Even
by
your
standards
American
Yeah
You
got
odds
for
us
this
time
I
think
A
thousand
to
one
Even
if
we
somehow
kill
this
beast
we
still
must
escape
We
fail
there
I
dont
think
they
will
be
so
kind
as
to
throw
us
back
in
a
cell
They
will
shoot
us
on
sight
Wed
die
as
monster
slayers
Youll
be
a
legend
But
still
a
traitor
You
forgot
traitor
Monster
slayer
trumps
traitor
I
bet
Mikhail
will
be
proud
of
his
pops
at
least
Mikhail
Mmm
No
I
cant
do
nothing
right
with
him
anymore
it
seems
He
will
say
Papa
I
bet
that
bald
American
did
most
of
the
monster
slaying
Hes
that
age
huh
Yeah
he
is
that
age
It
is
same
for
you
American
With
your
new
daughter
The
last
time
I
was
with
El
she
wanted
just
about
nothing
to
do
with
me
I
was
just
in
her
way
really
I
think
back
to
the
way
I
was
with
my
dad
at
that
age
I
was
the
same
way
The
exact
same
way
I
think
it
must
be
hardwired
into
us
to
reject
our
fathers
So
we
can
grow
and
move
on
Become
something
of
our
own
I
hope
thats
what
shes
doing
Coming
into
her
own
But
still
You
worry
To
worry
for
our
sons
and
daughters
that
is
natural
isnt
it
Yeah
But
nothing
about
what
El
has
had
to
deal
with
is
natural
That
beast
that
monster
in
there
its
a
part
of
something
that
wants
to
hurt
El
To
kill
her
I
dont
understand
To
be
honest
neither
do
I
All
I
know
is
that
thing
That
thing
shouldnt
be
here
It
shouldnt
be
alive
Because
it
is
it
means
it
still
isnt
over
I
thought
I
was
put
here
to
pay
for
what
Ive
done
But
I
mightve
been
put
here
for
some
other
reason
Maybe
I
Maybe
I
can
still
help
El
Even
if
its
the
last
thing
I
do
You
almost
sound
religious
American
Religious
I
dont
know
about
that
But
maybe
I
should
give
that
prayer
thing
a
try
Cause
if
we
wanna
get
out
of
here
get
back
to
El
and
Mikhail
you
and
me
Were
gonna
need
a
miracle
Can
I
help
you
comrade
My
name
is
Yuri
Ismaylov
Hello
The
warden
is
expecting
me
I
have
a
very
special
delivery
for
him
A
rare
import
from
America
Okay
okay
Im
okay
Try
your
best
not
to
blink
Any
more
headaches
Nausea
this
morning
How
about
your
memory
Can
you
remember
what
happened
now
Perhaps
someone
else
can
help
fill
in
the
gaps
Yes
Good
morning
children
Good
morning
Papa
Todays
lesson
is
going
to
be
about
rules
Ah
for
some
of
you
this
may
seem
redundant
For
others
it
appears
a
refresher
is
required
Eleven
please
step
forward
Last
night
your
sister
Eleven
suffered
a
concussion
during
her
alone
time
in
the
rainbow
room
Now
she
claims
to
not
have
a
memory
of
what
happened
But
injuries
of
this
nature
dont
simply
happen
Someone
did
this
Someone
in
this
room
Now
whos
going
to
tell
me
what
happened
She
mustve
fallen
Fallen
Youve
seen
her
Papa
Shes
clumsy
Stupid
Eleven
you
may
step
back
Number
Two
please
step
forward
Collar
him
Thank
you
You
think
because
you
demonstrate
some
talent
that
youre
somehow
immune
to
the
rules
is
that
it
No
Papa
That
the
rules
dont
apply
to
you
in
the
same
way
that
they
apply
to
your
brothers
and
sisters
No
Papa
Then
why
did
you
attack
Eleven
Did
she
tell
you
that
Are
you
asking
the
questions
or
am
I
Did
you
attack
Eleven
If
she
told
you
that
then
then
shes
lying
Papa
please
you
have
to
believe
me
Papa
please
Shes
lying
Now
shall
we
try
again
What
happened
It
was
an
accident
Couldnt
we
have
tried
a
road
or
something
just
slightly
less
creepy
I
think
were
getting
close
Were
almost
out
of
here
Dont
worry
Eddie
Eddie
Hey
man
Uh
Listen
I
just
uh
I
just
want
to
say
thanks
For
saving
my
ass
back
there
Shit
You
saved
your
own
ass
man
I
mean
that
was
a
real
Ozzy
move
you
pulled
back
there
Ozzy
When
you
took
a
bite
out
of
that
bat
Ozzy
Osbourne
Black
Sabbath
He
bit
a
bats
head
off
onstage
I
dont
You
know
Doesnt
matter
No
Its
very
metal
what
you
did
Thats
all
Im
saying
Thanks
Henderson
told
me
you
were
a
badass
Insisted
on
the
matter
in
fact
Henderson
said
that
Oh
yeah
Shit
Kid
worships
you
dude
Like
you
have
no
idea
Its
kinda
annoying
to
be
honest
I
dont
even
know
why
I
care
what
that
little
shrimp
thinks
but
uh
guess
I
got
a
little
jealous
Steve
I
guess
I
couldnt
accept
the
fact
that
Steve
Harrington
was
actually
a
good
dude
Rich
parents
popular
chicks
love
him
Not
a
douche
No
way
man
No
way
That
like
flies
in
the
face
of
all
the
laws
in
the
universe
and
my
own
personal
Munson
doctrine
Still
super
jealous
as
hell
by
the
way
Which
is
why
I
would
never
have
jumped
in
that
lake
to
save
your
ass
Not
under
any
uh
normal
circumstances
Nope
Outside
of
DD
I
am
no
hero
I
see
danger
and
I
just
turn
heel
and
run
Or
at
least
thats
what
Ive
learned
about
myself
this
week
Give
yourself
a
break
man
See
The
only
reason
I
came
in
here
was
cause
those
ladies
came
in
straight
after
you
Now
I
was
too
ashamed
to
be
the
one
who
stayed
behind
But
Wheeler
right
there
she
didnt
waste
a
second
Not
one
second
She
just
dove
right
in
Now
I
dont
know
what
happened
between
you
two
but
if
I
were
you
I
would
get
her
back
Cause
that
was
as
unambiguous
a
sign
of
true
love
as
these
cynical
eyes
have
ever
seen
Goddamn
it
Here
we
go
again
Second
on
my
list
of
least
favorite
things
earthquakes
Seriously
Im
unsteady
enough
as
it
is
Nancy
Where
are
you
going
Nancy
Nancy
Come
on
Steve
do
you
copy
Nancy
Robin
This
is
Dustin
Where
are
you
Weve
been
collared
by
the
law
I
repeat
weve
been
collared
by
the
law
Do
you
copy
Shit
Should
we
get
lawyers
Were
not
ready
for
that
As
far
as
we
know
nobody
did
anything
wrong
But
what
if
they
did
do
something
wrong
Anything
Nothing
You
dont
think
they
went
through
Through
Watergate
Without
us
Without
a
plan
Without
weapons
They
wouldnt
be
that
stupid
Yeah
They
must
just
be
laying
low
cause
the
law
got
us
The
law
What
is
this
Gun
smoke
The
Stupid
and
the
Ugly
Should
I
round
up
the
posse
Saddle
the
horses
Erica
Please
just
go
away
Heres
the
deal
Either
you
tell
me
whats
happening
or
I
tell
Dustin
what
I
found
under
your
bed
Please
no
Spill
your
guts
cowpuncher
Whatd
she
find
Nothing
Is
it
gross
Scale
of
one
to
ten
A
hundred
A
hundred
The
serial
killer
is
a
dark
wizard
from
the
Upside
Down
And
weve
been
looking
for
him
but
hes
in
the
Upside
Down
which
we
cant
reach
At
least
we
thought
we
couldnt
until
we
found
a
gate
at
Lovers
Lake
That
was
the
reason
why
we
were
there
but
these
stupid
cops
grabbed
us
And
if
you
tell
anyone
about
this
thats
including
Mom
and
Dad
and
Tina
especially
Tina
I
Will
smother
you
in
your
sleep
Do
you
understand
Hmm
Erica
Do
You
copy
The
smothering
in
my
sleep
part
but
not
much
else
Why
would
they
open
up
a
gate
at
Lovers
Lake
What
The
commies
The
commies
didnt
Then
who
did
Nobody
So
it
just
opened
up
for
fun
Erica
you
have
no
idea
what
youre
talking
about
No
she
doesnt
yet
she
raises
an
essential
question
How
did
Watergate
open
up
Only
two
gates
have
opened
so
far
as
we
know
One
by
El
one
by
the
commies
But
its
not
the
commies
or
El
this
time
so
it
Holy
shit
Wait
wait
wait
wait
Wait
wait
wait
what
Theres
one
thing
weve
never
understood
Which
is
why
Vecnas
killing
people
Whats
his
motive
Killing
teens
It
always
just
seemed
too
random
Too
prosaic
On
top
of
that
how
does
the
Mind
Flayer
figure
into
all
this
Maybe
this
is
it
This
is
the
answer
What
is
the
answer
You
sure
you
just
want
water
We
have
Coke
Sprite
Dr
Pepper
Coke
works
Thank
you
Okay
just
hear
me
out
How
did
El
open
the
Mother
gate
She
contacted
theDemogorgon
With
psychic
contact
Just
like
Vecna
when
he
casts
his
spells
Exactly
So
what
if
with
each
kill
hes
not
simply
killing
them
hes
making
a
powerful
psychic
connection
with
his
victims
A
connection
powerful
enough
to
rip
a
hole
in
the
fabric
of
time
and
space
Hes
opening
more
gates
Bingo
Copy
Were
still
at
the
Wheeler
house
Why
would
he
be
opening
gates
To
take
over
the
world
Who
do
we
know
that
wants
to
take
over
the
world
The
Mind
Flayer
So
if
the
Demogorgon
was
just
his
foot
soldier
Vecnas
his
fivestar
general
A
fivestar
general
with
the
power
to
open
gates
Holy
shit
Holy
shit
Holy
shit
That
was
incomprehensible
You
lost
me
at
Mother
gate
Please
be
kind
Rewind
Okay
so
remember
the
gate
Oh
no
I
blocked
that
out
So
what
was
that
giant
laser
Might
be
time
to
get
a
maid
Wheeler
Come
on
I
dont
want
to
stay
here
longer
than
we
have
to
Those
arent
guns
These
heels
are
pointy
but
I
was
hoping
fora
deadly
projectile
I
dont
understand
Maybe
you
left
them
somewhere
else
Theres
a
sixyearold
in
the
house
I
know
where
I
keep
my
guns
And
also
I
threw
these
away
years
ago
Jesus
How
many
did
you
make
You
said
you
wanted
to
help
I
get
that
grades
are
important
but
perhaps
studying
can
wait
till
we
get
out
These
are
from
sophomore
chemistry
And
this
this
wallpaper
this
is
old
wallpaper
And
this
mirror
this
went
to
a
yard
sale
And
you
Youre
not
supposed
to
be
here
No
I
gave
youto
Cousin
Joanna
two
years
ago
What
is
it
Nancy
Youre
freaking
me
out
I
think
the
reason
that
my
guns
arent
here
is
because
they
dont
exist
yet
They
dont
exist
This
diary
should
be
full
of
entries
Its
not
The
last
entry
is
November
The
day
Will
went
missing
The
day
the
gate
opened
Were
in
the
past
Dustin
Dustin
Dustin
Can
you
hear
me
Dustin
Du
Hello
Hel
Hello
Maybe
he
really
does
have
rabies
Hello
Hello
What
are
you
doing
Hello
Hes
here
Henderson
That
little
shit
hes
here
Hes
like
Hes
in
the
walls
or
something
Just
listen
Dustin
Dustin
Dustin
Dustin
Dustin
Can
you
hear
me
That
brings
us
to
the
question
you
first
raised
How
and
why
is
there
a
gate
at
Lovers
Lake
Lets
analyze
What
do
Eleven
and
Vecna
have
in
common
Dustin
Dustin
Dustin
All
right
either
this
kid
cant
hear
us
or
hes
being
a
total
douche
bag
Will
found
a
way
What
Will
He
found
a
way
to
speak
to
Joyce
through
the
lights
Lights
Yeah
The
switch
Try
the
switch
Okay
Its
not
working
Guys
You
seeing
this
to
open
a
tear
in
time
and
space
just
like
the
Mother
gate
Whoa
are
these
like
the
Mother
gate
But
a
gate
nonetheless
It
Tickles
It
kinda
feels
good
Does
anyone
know
Morse
code
No
Wait
does
SOS
count
Is
that
Is
that
good
So
our
working
theory
is
that
Vecna
makes
remote
contact
from
his
attic
We
dont
know
why
We
assume
he
can
do
it
from
anywhere
Are
you
even
listening
to
me
Im
listening
Its
just
You
said
you
followed
Vecna
through
lights
right
Yeah
why
Because
I
think
hes
here
Its
working
S
O
S
Hey
uh
remember
when
I
said
they
wouldnt
be
stupid
enough
to
go
through
Watergate
Yeah
I
overestimated
them
Warden
beautiful
prison
you
got
here
How
about
this
Huh
How
about
that
Huh
Huh
Thats
what
I
thought
yeah
Warden
So
nice
to
meet
you
Uh
Im
Yuri
of
course
but
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
very
Shit
Murray
Im
sorry
What
Can
you
please
stop
playing
with
that
thing
I
am
not
playing
I
am
practicing
Will
you
please
stop
trying
to
talk
to
me
and
stay
in
character
Remember
you
are
frightened
scared
confused
Yes
I
am
frightened
scared
and
Okay
All
right
Yes
Good
Yuri
Ismaylov
At
last
we
meet
Comrade
Major
This
is
the
Bauman
spy
He
looks
different
Uglier
in
person
I
know
He
also
shaved
his
beard
to
disguise
himself
Tricky
bastard
Silence
American
scum
Enough
from
you
Enough
Now
this
one
This
one
I
would
recognize
a
continent
away
She
was
more
beautiful
in
her
uniform
but
still
quite
striking
isnt
she
Yes
very
pleasing
to
the
eyes
comrade
But
not
so
pleasing
to
the
ears
I
am
afraid
Where
is
he
What
have
you
done
with
Hopper
you
vile
commie
pig
As
I
said
unpleasant
But
I
must
say
I
too
am
curious
The
other
American
What
did
you
do
with
him
I
dont
know
why
but
I
imagine
him
on
a
rack
in
the
cold
stretched
thin
birds
pecking
his
eyeballs
Am
I
close
I
have
heard
stories
ofYuri
Ismaylov
the
Peanut
Butter
Smuggler
And
you
You
are
not
the
Yuri
I
have
heard
of
I
am
I
am
not
No
No
The
Yuri
I
was
told
of
had
a
screw
loose
And
you
Have
many
screws
loose
I
hope
we
have
not
missed
the
show
On
the
contrary
just
in
time
This
key
here
will
give
you
access
to
that
weapons
locker
Choose
any
weapon
you
like
Work
together
or
alone
What
what
is
happening
They
are
being
told
the
rules
Rules
for
what
I
could
tell
you
but
that
would
spoil
the
fun
now
wouldnt
it
You
wait
for
the
buzzer
You
wait
You
move
before
the
buzzer
you
will
be
shot
Is
that
understood
Is
that
understood
Yes
Id
wish
you
luck
but
it
wont
help
you
Let
us
hope
your
prayers
have
been
heard
American
You
open
for
something
a
little
more
challenging
Try
not
to
show
any
emotion
as
I
speak
okay
Just
keep
playing
the
game
if
you
understand
Two
is
still
in
the
infirmary
recovering
Hes
being
watched
now
but
once
he
is
released
he
and
the
others
are
going
to
attempt
to
kill
you
Right
here
in
this
room
And
Papa
will
allow
it
to
happen
In
fact
he
wants
it
to
happen
Hes
been
planning
it
for
some
time
now
Stay
calm
Focus
on
the
game
Theres
a
reason
why
Two
and
the
others
were
able
to
escape
their
room
last
night
Why
the
security
cameras
were
turned
off
Why
Papa
punished
Two
today
They
dont
even
realize
it
but
he
is
moving
them
like
pieces
on
this
board
here
Driving
them
to
do
exactly
what
he
wants
which
is
Why
You
frighten
him
He
knows
you
are
more
powerful
than
the
others
And
he
also
knows
he
cant
control
you
Thats
all
he
wants
Control
I
saw
all
this
happening
Thats
why
I
wanted
to
help
you
but
I
only
made
things
worse
Helping
me
Made
Papa
hurt
you
And
it
is
why
you
must
escape
Today
But
they
are
watching
us
Closely
If
you
want
to
make
it
out
of
here
alive
you
must
do
exactly
as
I
say
Do
you
understand
Why
do
you
still
help
Because
I
believe
in
you
It
is
time
you
are
free
from
this
hell

finds
me

find
you
What

On
the
other
side
Nice
Nancy
Hey
Hey
Stay
with
me
Nancy
Hey
Nancy
wake
up
Wake
up
Nancy
Vecna
Do
you
remember
what
you
did
Nancy
Or
have
you
already
forgotten
When
I
kill
someone
I
never
forget
Nancy
I
asked
you
to
wait
Why
do
you
cry
for
them
Eleven
After
everything
they
did
to
you
Hmm
You
think
you
need
them
but
you
dont
You
dont
Oh
but
I
know
youre
just
scared
I
was
scared
once
too
I
know
what
its
like
to
be
different
To
be
alone
in
this
world
I
see
youve
been
looking
for
me
Nancy
You
were
so
close
So
close
to
the
truth
How
was
old
blind
dumb
Victor
Did
he
miss
me
Ive
been
meaning
to
check
back
in
but
Ive
been
busy
So
very
busy
Whatd
I
tell
ya
Wow
This
is
amazing
It
looks
like
a
fairy
tale
A
dream
Alice
no
running
Its
so
big
This
is
nice
Yeah
Yeah
Like
you
I
didnt
fit
in
with
the
other
children
Something
was
wrong
with
me
All
the
teachers
and
the
doctors
said
I
was
Broken
they
said
My
parents
thought
a
change
of
scenery
a
fresh
start
in
Hawkins
might
just
cure
me
It
was
absurd
As
if
the
world
would
be
any
different
here
But
then
To
my
surprise
our
new
home
provided
a
discovery
And
a
new
found
sense
of
purpose
I
found
a
nest
of
black
widows
living
inside
a
vent
Most
people
fear
spiders
They
detest
them
And
yet
I
found
them
endlessly
fascinating
More
than
that
I
found
a
great
comfort
in
them
A
kinship
Like
me
they
are
solitary
creatures
And
deeply
misunderstood
They
are
gods
of
our
world
The
most
important
of
all
predators
They
immobilize
and
feed
on
the
weak
bringing
balance
and
order
to
an
unstable
ecosystem
But
the
human
world
was
disrupting
this
harmony
You
see
humans
are
a
unique
type
of
pest
multiplying
and
poisoning
our
world
all
while
enforcing
a
structure
of
their
own
A
deeply
unnatural
structure
Where
others
saw
order
I
saw
a
straitjacket
A
cruel
oppressive
world
dictated
by
madeup
rules
Seconds
minutes
hours
days
weeks
months
years
decades
Each
life
a
faded
lesser
copy
of
the
one
before
Wake
up
eat
work
sleep
reproduce
and
die
Everyone
is
just
waiting
Waiting
for
it
all
to
be
over
All
while
performing
in
a
silly
terrible
play
day
after
day
I
could
not
do
that
I
could
not
close
off
my
mind
and
join
in
the
madness
I
could
not
pretend
And
I
realized
I
didnt
have
to
I
could
make
my
own
rules
I
could
restore
balance
to
a
broken
world
A
predator
But
for
good
As
I
practiced
I
realized
I
could
do
more
than
I
possibly
imagined
I
could
reach
into
others
into
their
minds
their
memories
I
became
an
explorer
I
saw
my
parents
as
they
truly
were
To
the
world
they
presented
themselves
as
good
normal
people
But
like
everything
else
in
this
world
it
was
all
a
lie
A
terrible
lie
They
had
done
things
Eleven
Such
awful
things
I
showed
them
who
they
really
were
I
held
up
a
mirror
My
naive
father
believed
it
was
a
demon
cursing
them
for
their
sins
But
my
mother
somehow
knew
Knew
it
was
I
who
was
holding
up
that
mirror
and
she
despised
me
for
it
She
called
a
doctor
an
expert
She
wanted
him
to
lock
me
away
to
fix
me
even
though
it
wasnt
I
who
was
broken
It
was
them
And
so
she
left
me
with
no
choice
No
choice
but
to
act
To
break
free
With
each
life
I
took
I
grew
stronger
More
powerful
They
were
becoming
a
part
of
me
But
I
was
still
a
child
And
I
did
not
yet
know
my
limits
And
it
nearly
killed
me
He
was
arrested
blamed
for
the
death
of
my
sister
and
mother
just
as
I
had
planned
But
I
was
far
from
free
I
woke
up
from
my
coma
only
to
find
myself
placed
in
the
care
of
a
doctor
the
very
doctor
I
had
hoped
to
escape
Dr
Martin
Brenner
Papa
But
the
truth
The
truth
is
he
did
not
just
want
to
study
me
He
wanted
more
He
wanted
to
control
When
Papa
finally
realized
he
could
not
control
me
he
tried
to
recreate
me
He
began
a
program
And
soon
others
were
born
You
were
born
And
I
am
so
glad
you
were
Eleven
So
very
glad
Theyre
not
gone
Eleven
Theyre
still
with
me
In
here
You
tricked
me
Tricked
you
No
I
saved
you
You
are
a
prisoner
here
just
like
me
To
your
papa
you
are
nothing
more
than
an
animal
a
monster
a
lab
rat
to
be
tamed
But
the
truth
Eleven
the
truth
is
just
the
opposite
You
are
better
than
they
are
Superior
That
is
why
you
frighten
him
If
you
come
with
me
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
you
will
be
free
Imagine
what
we
could
do
together
We
could
reshape
the
world
remake
it
however
we
see
fit
Join
me
No
He
had
found
his
strength
in
a
memory
from
his
past
Something
that
made
him
sad
But
also
angry
Do
you
have
a
memory
like
that
No
No
Jane
No
No
It
wasnt
supposed
to
end
like
this
Jane

Holy

Check

they

Nevada
Watch
outDominos
Your
dominoes

gonna
fall
How
far
is
Nina
from
Vegas
From
Vegas
Um
as
long
as
Suzies
coordinates
are
right
about
another
miles
Why
Well
once
we
save
her
El
we
should
stop
on
the
way
back
El
could
make
us
like
super
rich
and
wed
never
have
to
work
We
could
just
play
DD
and
Nintendo
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
Yeah
Totally
Were
gonna
make
it
Mike
Shes
gonna
be
okay
Yeah
I
know
I
I
know
she
is
But
But
what
if
after
all
this
is
over
she
Sh
she
doesnt
need
me
anymore
No
o
of
course
shell
still
need
you
Shell
always
need
you
Mike
I
keep
telling
myself
that
but
I
I
dont
believe
it
I
mean
shes
special
She
was
born
special
Maybe
I
was
one
of
the
first
people
to
realize
that
But
the
truth
is
when
I
stumbled
on
her
in
the
woods
she
just
needed
someone
Its
not
fate
Its
Its
not
destiny
Its
just
simple
dumb
luck
And
one
day
shes
gonna
realize
Im
just
some
random
nerd
that
got
lucky
that
Superman
landed
on
his
doorstep
I
mean
at
leastLois
Lane
is
an
ace
reporter
for
the
Daily
Planet
right
But
Sorry
No
No
I
its
so
stupid
given
everything
thats
going
on
Its
just
I
I
dont
know
I
just
Uh
Youre
scared
of
losing
her
Can
I
show
you
something
This
is
amazing
Did
you
paint
this
Yeah
Yeah
I
mean
I
mean
I
mean
El
asked
me
to
She
commissioned
it
basically
I
mean
she
told
me
what
to
draw
Anyway
my
point
is
see
how
youre
leading
us
here
Youre
guiding
the
whole
party
inspiring
us
That
Thats
what
you
do
And
see
your
coat
of
arms
here
Its
a
heart
And
I
know
its
sort
of
on
the
nose
but
thats
what
holds
this
party
together
Heart
Because
I
mean
without
heart
wed
all
fall
apart
Even
El
Especially
El
These
past
few
months
shes
been
so
lost
without
you
Its
just
shes
so
different
from
other
people
and
when
youre
when
youre
different
sometimes
you
feel
like
a
mistake
But
you
make
her
feel
like
shes
not
a
mistake
at
all
Like
shes
better
for
being
different
And
that
gives
her
the
courage
to
fight
on
If
she
was
mean
to
you
or
she
seemed
like
she
was
pushing
you
away
its
because
shes
scared
of
losing
you
like
youre
scared
of
losing
her
And
if
she
was
going
to
lose
you
I
I
think
shed
rather
just
get
it
over
with
quick
Like
ripping
off
aBandAid
So
yeah
El
needs
you
Mike
And
she
always
will
Yeah
Yeah
After
the
attack
you
fell
into
a
coma
Like
One
you
had
pushed
yourself
beyond
your
limit
And
it
very
nearly
destroyed
you
But
that
is
where
your
similarities
ended
What
you
displayed
that
day
was
beyond
anything
Id
ever
imagined
A
potential
Id
only
dreamed
of
But
when
you
awoke
something
had
been
lost
Your
memories
along
with
whatever
else
youd
found
within
yourself
that
day
But
I
knew
then
just
as
I
knew
today
that
your
powers
had
not
been
lost
They
just
needed
a
spark
But
that
day
you
awakened
something
else
A
doorway
to
another
world
I
always
thought
that
Henry
was
out
there
hiding
in
the
darkness
I
didnt
know
for
sure
not
beyond
a
feeling
Until
now
Hes
claimed
three
victims
so
far
and
when
I
saw
the
eyes
I
knew
I
knew
that
was
him
He
was
sending
us
a
message
letting
us
know
hes
back
Thats
when
I
came
to
see
you
My
friends
Well
we
we
havent
risked
contact
but
as
far
as
we
know
theyre
theyre
all
safe
But
Im
not
gonna
lie
to
you
Eleven
Your
friends
are
in
terrible
danger
With
each
victim
he
takes
Henry
is
Chiseling
away
at
the
barrier
that
exists
between
our
two
worlds
Chiseling
Imagine
if
you
will
the
barrier
between
our
worlds
is
a
Concrete
dam
Henry
is
putting
cracks
in
this
dam
Cracks
in
dams
create
pressure
Left
unchecked
the
pressure
will
build
And
build
And
eventually
it
will
reach
a
breaking
point
And
the
dam
will
burst
And
when
that
happens
Hawkins
will
fall
Well
that
went
very
well
I
thought
You
eased
her
into
it
nice
and
gentle
just
like
we
talked
about
Not
ominous
at
all
He
showed
me
things
that
havent
happened
yet
The
most
awful
things
I
saw
a
dark
cloud
spreading
over
Hawkins
Downtown
on
fire
Dead
soldiers
And
this
Giant
creature
with
a
gaping
mouth
And
this
creature
wasnt
alone
There
were
so
many
monsters
An
army
And
they
were
coming
into
Hawkins
Into
our
neighborhoods
Our
homes
And
then
He
showed
me
my
mom
And
Holly
Mike
And
they
They
were
all
Okay
but
hes
just
trying
to
scare
you
Nance
Right
I
mean
I
mean
its
not
real
Not
yet
But
there
there
was
something
else
He
showed
me
gates
Four
gates
Spreading
across
Hawkins
And
these
gates
they
looked
like
the
one
outside
of
Eddies
trailer
but
they
didnt
stop
growing
And
this
wasnt
the
Upside
Down
Hawkins
This
was
our
Hawkins
Our
home
Four
chimes
Vecnas
clock
It
always
chimes
four
times
Four
exactly
I
heard
them
too
Hes
been
telling
us
his
plan
this
whole
time
Four
kills
Four
gates
End
of
the
world
If
thats
true
Hes
only
one
kill
away
Oh
Jesus
Christ
Jesus
Christ
Try
em
againTry
em
again
Anything
No
Rang
a
few
times
then
went
to
busy
signal
Maybe
you
punched
it
wrong
Try
again
I
didnt
punch
it
in
wrong
Well
I
dont
know
I
think
she
knows
how
to
use
a
phone
Im
just
saying
she
couldve
typed
it
in
wrong
Same
shit
How
is
that
possible
Joyce
has
this
telemarketer
job
Always
on
the
phone
Mike
wont
stop
whining
about
it
Yeah
but
this
phones
been
busy
for
what
three
days
now
Thats
not
Joyce
No
way
Somethings
wrong
Shes
right
It
cant
be
just
coincidence
It
cant
be
Whatevers
happening
in
Lenora
is
connected
to
all
of
this
Im
sure
of
it
But
Vecna
cant
hurt
them
Not
if
hes
dead
We
have
to
go
back
in
there
Back
to
the
Upside
Down
Whoa
no
no
no
What
Nope
Lets
think
this
through
What
is
there
to
think
through
We
barely
made
it
out
of
there
Yeah
because
we
werent
prepared
But
this
time
we
will
be
Well
get
weapons
and
protection
Well
go
through
the
gate
well
find
his
lair
and
well
kill
him
Or
hell
kill
us
The
only
reason
you
survived
is
because
he
wanted
you
to
Hes
not
scared
of
us
And
for
good
reason
We
were
wrong
about
Vecna
HenryOne
Sorry
what
are
we
calling
him
now
One
Vecna
Henry
Right
Weve
learned
something
new
about
VecnaHenryOne
Hes
a
number
like
Eleven
only
a
sick
evil
male
childmurdering
version
of
her
with
really
bad
skin
But
my
my
point
is
hes
super
powerful
Could
turn
us
inside
out
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
Its
not
a
fair
fight
Then
why
fight
fair
Youre
right
Hes
like
Eleven
But
that
gives
us
an
upper
hand
We
know
Elevens
strengths
And
weaknesses
Weaknesses
When
El
remotetravels
she
goes
into
this
sort
oftrancelike
state
I
bet
the
same
is
true
of
Vecna
That
would
explain
what
he
was
doing
in
that
attic
Exactly
When
he
attacks
his
next
victim
Ill
bet
you
hes
back
in
that
attic
physical
body
defenseless
Defenseless
What
about
the
army
of
bats
True
Well
have
to
find
a
way
past
them
Distract
them
somehow
And
uh
how
do
we
do
that
exactly
No
idea
But
once
theyre
gone
he
doesnt
stand
a
chance
Itll
be
like
slaying
sleeping
Dracula
in
his
coffin
That
all
sounds
good
in
theory
but
there
is
no
pattern
to
Vecnas
killings
Not
one
that
I
can
decipher
We
dont
know
when
hes
going
to
attack
next
Dont
even
know
who
hes
going
to
attack
Yeah
we
do
I
can
still
feel
him
Im
still
marked
Cursed
I
ditch
Kate
Bush
I
draw
his
focus
back
to
me
Max
You
cant
Hell
kill
you
I
survived
before
I
can
survive
again
I
just
need
to
keep
him
busy
long
enough
so
that
you
guys
can
get
into
that
attic
Then
you
can
chop
his
head
off
Stab
him
in
the
heart
Blow
him
up
with
some
explosive
Dustin
cooks
up
I
honestly
dont
care
how
you
put
this
asshole
in
his
grave
Just
whatever
it
is
Whatever
you
do
Try
not
to
miss
Bam
Durak
Son
of
a
bitch
Sayonara
Oh
GodOh
God
Son
of
a
bitch
You
okay
All
right
Yeah
You
okay
Okay
Im
great
Whoo
Oh
nothing
like
a
little
prison
escape
to
get
your
day
started
am
I
right
Were
not
out
of
the
woods
yet
My
people
do
not
take
kindly
to
escapes
Theyll
be
hunting
us
Yeah
well
we
arent
exactly
planning
on
sticking
around
Wheres
the
plane
you
came
in
on
That
plane
Um
that
crashed
Crashed
His
fault
A
word
of
warning
That
man
is
more
slippery
than
an
eel
dipped
in
baby
oil
I
wouldnt
trust
a
word
out
of
his
mouth
My
tongue
My
tongue
I
I
cant
feel
my
tongue
We
need
to
get
out
of
here
back
to
the
States
Can
you
get
us
to
another
plane
Now
Youre
asking
for
Yuris
help
after
dragging
him
through
miles
of
shit
tunnel
I
could
have
told
you
we
are
going
wrong
way
hours
ago
You
Neanderthal
Watch
your
mouth
or
I
am
gonna
take
this
Im
gonna
rub
it
along
the
bottom
of
my
shoe
and
Im
gonna
jam
it
down
your
throat
Well
go
ahead
But
then
youll
never
make
it
out
of
my
country
alive
So
you
can
get
us
out
For
a
glass
of
water
and
hot
steam
bath
and
fiveinch
stack
of
American
dollars
Yuri
will
fly
you
to
moon
You
make
another
demand
you
doublecrossing
mudak
Ill
decorate
the
roof
of
this
van
with
your
brains
Why
so
angry
comrade
Rough
couple
of
days
for
you
Im
sure
But
now
you
are
free
Everything
works
out
Happy
ending
for
everybody
No
For
you
that
will
very
much
depend
on
how
you
answer
Comrade
Will
you
take
us
to
America
Yes
Or
no
Check
this
out
The
War
Zone
Ive
been
there
once
Its
huge
They
got
everything
you
need
for
uh
Well
killing
things
basically
You
think
fake
Rambo
has
enough
guns
there
Is
that
a
grenade
I
mean
how
is
any
of
this
legal
Well
lucky
for
us
it
is
so
This
This
place
is
just
far
enough
outside
of
Hawkins
As
long
as
we
steer
clear
of
main
roads
we
ought
a
be
able
to
avoid
cops
and
uh
angry
hicks
If
were
trying
to
avoid
angry
hicks
maybe
we
shouldnt
go
to
some
store
called
the
War
Zone
Normally
Id
agree
but
we
need
the
weapons
So
I
think
its
worth
the
risk
Me
too
But
is
it
worth
the
time
Itll
take
all
day
to
bike
there
and
back
Who
said
anything
about
bikes
You
got
some
car
we
dont
know
about
Its
not
exactly
a
car
Steve
And
its
not
exactly
mine
but
uh
itll
do
Hey
Red
uh
you
got
a
ski
mask
or
a
bandanna
something
like
that
That
was
suffocating
Go
Come
on
Whered
you
learn
how
to
do
this
Well
when
the
other
dads
were
teaching
their
kids
how
to
fish
or
play
ball
my
old
man
was
teaching
me
how
to
hotwire
Now
I
swore
to
myself
I
wouldnt
wind
up
like
he
did
but
now
Im
wanted
for
murder
and
soon
grand
theft
auto
So
uh
Im
really
living
up
to
that
Munson
name
Eddie
Im
not
sure
I
love
the
idea
of
you
driving
Oh

just
starting
this
sucker
Harringtons
got
her
Dont
ya
big
boy
What
the
hell
Hey
Open
this
door
Hey
They
locked
the
door
Shit

just
a
car
Everybody
hang
on
to
something
Oh

God
Lets
go
Lets
go
Drive
Steve
Drive
Go

Shit

Its
not
every
day

lose
your
house
and
car
in
one
fell
swoop
Hold
onHold
on
Them
Stop
em
God
bless
it
Okay
My
friends
I
saw
them
You
told
me
they
were
safe
They
are
not
safe
Whoa
whoa
whoa
okay
Uh
just
give
us
a
second
please
Please
Okay
okay
first
first
things
first
Were
not
gonna
let
anything
happen
to
your
friends
okay
kiddo
I
will
personally
make
sure
of
that
Did
Did
you
see
where
they
were
They
were
at
They
were
at
Maxs
house
Theyre
planning
to
kill
him
To
kill
Henry
Okay
Okay
This
Does
this
Max
have
a
last
name
Max
Max
Mayfield
Okay
So
heres
whats
gonna
happen
I
have
people
in
Hawkins
and
Im
gonna
send
some
to
Max
Mayfield
And
they
will
stop
him
Her
Stop
her
And
the
rest
of
them
from
whatever
foolish
although
wellintentioned
mission
that
theyre
attempting
alright
No
No
do
not
send
your
men
Send
me
Your
friends
are
not
prepared
for
this
fight
Eleven
And
neither
are
you
You
must
understand
when
One
kills
he
doesnt
simply
kill
He
consumes
He
takes
everything
from
his
victims
Everything
they
are
and
everything
they
ever
will
be
Their
memories
their
abilities
And
we
do
not
know
where
hes
been
these
lost
years
But
if
he
has
survived
this
long
we
can
only
assume
that
he
has
grown
in
strength
To
underestimate
him
to
act
rashly
would
be
very
dangerous
I
dont
want
to
upset
you
Eleven
What
youve
accomplished
is
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
You
came
to
me
broken
And
youve
learned
to
walk
again
But
if
you
want
to
stop
One
you
will
need
to
do
more
than
walk
You
will
need
to
do
more
than
run
You
will
need
to
fly
And
youre
not
ready
My
friends
need
me
Ive
stopped
him
once
I
will
again
Im
sorry
You
cant
Its
impossible
Nothings
impossible
I
can
call
Stinson
Shes
got
connections
at
Nellis
Thats
two
hours
away
And
if
we
hustle
Ill
bet
we
can
be
in
Hawkins
before
nightfall
That
would
be
a
grave
mistake
Waiting
would
be
an
even
greater
mistake
What
if
One
makes
his
move
before
weve
had
a
chance
to
throw
a
punch
Then
what
is
the
point
of
all
this
Thats
a
risk
were
going
to
have
to
take
We
pushed
her
before
and
look
what
happened
She
lifted
a
pound
tank
into
the
goddamn
air
You
dont
understand
what
hes
capable
of
Maybe
youre
right
Or
maybe
you
are
overestimating
him
Either
way
doesnt
matter
because
this
is
not
our
choice
We
agreed
this
was
not
gonna
be
a
prison
Well
show
her
what
this
is
what
we
can
offer
and
then
it
is
her
choice
whether
she
wants
to
stay
or
go
Right
Doc
You
may
not
agree
with
it
but
here
she
is
standing
before
us
making
a
choice
Youre
sure
you
wanna
do
this
Okay
Pack
your
things
say
your
goodbyes
Hows
it
handle
Not
half
bad
Considering
that
this
is
a
House
Yeah
its
Its
silly
but
I
Ive
actually
I
always
had
this
dream
that
Id
have
this
really
really
big
family
Im
talking
like
uh
a
full
brood
of
Harringtons
Like
five
six
kids
Six
Yeah
Six
little
nuggets
Three
girls
three
boys
And
and
every
summer
I
figured
all
of
us
Harringtons
we
would
pack
into
something
like
this
and
just
see
the
country
You
know
the
Rockies
Grand
Canyon
maybe
Yellowstone
End
up
in
some
beach
side
town
in
California
Spend
a
week
parked
in
the
sand
Learn
how
to
surf
or
something
That
sounds
nice
Yeah
Yeah
Well
uh
except
for
the
sixkid
part
That
sounds
like
a
total
nightmare
If
only
I
had
some
practice
All
right
Fair
Thats
fair
Hey
So
Ive
been
thinking
two
of
the
three
of
Vecnas
victims
were
seeing
Ms
Kelley
right
Yeah
Okay
So
I
figure
theres
a
good
chance
Vecna
cursed
another
one
of
her
students
We
go
back
to
her
office
We
read
all
of
her
files
Look
for
mentions
of
headaches
nosebleeds
nightmares
We
identify
his
most
likely
next
victim
Lucas
We
stake
out
his
house
Lucas
stop
We
dont
have
time
for
any
of
that
okay
And
even
if
we
did
even
if
your
plan
did
work
wed
be
putting
a
total
stranger
at
risk
A
stranger
who
has
no
idea
what
theyre
up
against
I
do
He
uses
my
memories
against
me
But
only
my
darkest
memories
Same
with
Chrissy
and
Fred
right
Right
Its
like
he
only
sees
the
darkness
in
us
So
Ill
just
run
in
the
opposite
direction
Run
to
the
light
And
maybe
he
wont
be
able
to
find
me
there
Now
how
exactly
do
you
plan
on
doing
this
Im
not
sure
But
its
my
mind
Not
his
right
So
I
should
be
able
to
control
where
I
am
I
just
need
to
push
him
away
Find
a
happy
memory
and
hide
there
Hide
in
the
light
You
got
a
memory
in
mind
Yeah
It
was
a
time
when
I
was
the
happiest
Was
I
there
Thats
presumptuous
of
you
But
yeah
You
mightve
been
there
Okay
but
the
second
you
start
to
lift
Im
calling
in
Kate
Bush
All
right
Okay
Deal
Deal
Heh
come
on
This
way
If
I
get
a
whiff
of
any
funny
business
smuggler
I
will
not
hesitate
to
kill
you
In
factI
am
just
looking
for
a
reason
Understand
Are
you
a
parrot
cop
You
keep
repeating
the
same
thing
You
were
trapped
in
a
cell
with
this
dull
man
and
you
didnt
take
opportunity
to
smother
him
Beautiful
yes
Please
tell
me
this
is
another
poor
joke
You
said
you
had
a
plane
A
plane
No
no
no
I
I
told
you
I
could
fly
you
home
And
Katinka
can
fly
you
home
little
bird
She
was
named
Katinka
after
my
first
lover
Katinka
also
had
very
beautiful
very
round
buttocks
Uh
mu
much
like
this
This
cannot
fly
us
to
America
Why
not
As
long
as
winds
are
not
too
strong
and
your
military
friends
do
not
shoot
us
out
of
sky
we
can
make
it
to
the
coast
There
while
we
refuel
we
skin
dip
in
icecold
water
and
wash
off
this
muck
Then
we
fly
her
rest
of
the
way
Happy
ending
Okay
what
is
the
furthest
Katinka
has
ever
flown
For
me
she
is
still
a
virgin
Uh
not
real
Katinka
Goodness
no
That
Katinka
no
But
this
Katinka
pretty
much
unspoiled
But
Im
sure
she
will
soar
when
given
a
chance
She
just
need
little
tuneup
I
did
warn
you
Jim
Okay
Should
I
shoot
him
now
Or
later
What
about
Owens
He
Hes
gotta
have
contacts
or
spies
here
that
could
help
us
Can
we
do
that
Can
we
make
a
call
to
the
States
Yes
hello
miss
Id
like
to
place
a
call
to
the
United
States
A
very
sick
relative
Correct
YesThe
number
is
The
number
Its
Da
spasibo
What
are
you
doing
How
exactly
do
you
think
this
works
They
will
make
the
call
for
us
and
then
they
will
call
us
back
How
longs
that
gonna
take
Five
minutes
Five
hours
Five
days
Who
knows
And
when
we
do
get
the
call
assume
the
KGB
will
be
on
the
other
line
listening
to
everything
you
say
So
I
suggest
talking
in
code
Say
the
wrong
thing
and
they
will
be
on
us
like
flies
on
shit
Welcome
to
the
Soviet
Union

just
scary
times
Im
sorry
aboutChrissy
Want
my
advice
Shotguns
are
not
good
for
much
of
anything
past
killing
small
birds
I
mean
they
got
power
sure
but
not
much
range
And
thats
just
gonna
force
you
into
closerange
combat
then
someone
can
just
grab
that
barrel
like
this
and
redirect
it
Well
you
look
nervous
Like
I
said
scary
times
Now
your
brother
he
uh
Is

you
by
chance
Mike
Mike

I

What

They

Would

Let

we
looking
for
my
dudes
Some
sort
of
facility
A
fence
A
building
Any
signs
of
life
would
be
nice
Since
when
did
we
decide
Nina
was
a
building
and
not
a
small
woman
Sounds
like
a
small
woman
to
me
Its
not
a
small
woman
Small
woman
out
in
this
desert
would
be
hard
to
see
How
is
he
still
high
Sure
you
got
your
measurements
right
Yes
theyre
right
Youre
right
Yes
Maybe
latitude
and
longitude
are
wrong
Are
you
really
questioning
Suzie
Shes
a
genius
Jonathan
Even
geniuses
make
mistakes
Well
she
didnt
If
that
small
woman
is
small
enough
she
could
fit
behind
a
small
tree
Stop
Just
Ouch
What
are
you
doing
I
am
stopping
us
before
we
get
more
lost
Give

the
coordinates
Um

Longitude

five
minutes
and
Slow

Slow

Nina
Nina
Nina
Nina
Holy
macaroni
All
right
You

go
straight
down
Like
straight
straight
Right
on
the
money
as
I

It
just
doesnt
make
sense
Yo

My

Jesus

Gotta

Pronto
Okay
So

Nina
But

I
right
Right
Well
these
are
no
regular
tire
tracks
brochachos
I
mean
look
at
the
tread
on
these
monsters
Theyre
fatties
And
you
know
what
that
means
Military
We
gotta
go
Well
I
wouldnt
do
it
if
I
didnt
think
she
was
ready
But
either
way
I
dont
think
we
have
any
other
choice
Do
you
No
I
dont
Yeah
It
might
take
me
some
time
though
Just
As
fast
as
you
can
Its
gonna
take
us
two
hours
to
get
to
Nellis
as
it
is
And
Ellen
one
more
favor
Can
you
send
somebody
over
to
a
Max
Mayfields
house
There
are
some
kids
there
that
just
need
looking
after
okay
Ellen
Hello
Sam
Hello
Why
the
long
face
Doc
We
just
wanna
talk
No
Wait
No
No
What
You
cant
leave
Eleven
Where
is
Dr
Owens
Dr
Owens
had
a
change
of
heart
I
know
you
wish
to
go
to
him
and
theres
nothing
I
can
do
to
stop
you
from
forcing
open
that
door
But
if
my
men
hear
you
coming
they
will
kill
him
And
alone
you
will
never
find
your
way
out
of
this
desert
to
your
friends
Heres
what
were
going
to
do
You
and
I
are
going
to
complete
our
work
together
And
when
I
decide
that
you
are
ready
we
will
return
to
Hawkins
together
Papa
and
daughter
Why
are
you
doing
this
Because
theres
no
other
choice
There
is
a
choice
Only
one
that
is
right
And
you
make
the
right
choices
I
try
Did
you
make
the
right
choice
with
Mama
Fourfifty
Your
mother
was
sick
Eleven
She
was
a
danger
to
herself
and
to
others
She
brought
a
gun
into
the
hospital
She
killed
a
man
Hospital
No
A
prison
Everything
I
have
done
was
for
your
own
good
For
your
own
protection
And
Henry
You
kept
Henry
in
that
lab
With
the
children
Was
that
for
our
good
Was
that
a
right
choice
I
had
no
idea
what
Henry
would
do
I
cared
for
you
I
loved
you
I
loved
all
of
you
Even
Henry
Yes
I
was
trying
to
help
Henry
to
understand
him
Yes
Yes
I
cared
for
him
Even
after
what
what
he
did
Yes
Because
I
knew
I
had
failed
him
So
this
morning
you
said
you
believed
he
was
always
alive
in
the
darkness
Is
that
why
I
was
searching
the
darkness
Was
I
looking
for
him
For
Henry
No
No
We
were
focused
on
the
Soviets
You
knew
that
Papa
does
not
tell
the
truth
Henry
said
that
And
now
you
trust
Henry
Henry
whos
manipulated
you
like
some
puppet
You
are
the
one
who
released
him
from
his
prison
You
And
now
you
are
angry
with
yourself
and
youre
taking
your
anger
out
on
me
and
youre
risking
everything
No
No
you
You
have
risked
everything
You
have
lied
You
made
me
look
for
him
The
gate
The
Mind
Flayer
So
many
dead
And
all
because
of
you
Because
you
could
not
stop
You
could
not
let
him
go
I
came
here
to
try
and
understand
who
I
was
To
see
if
I
If
I
was
the
monster
Papa
And
now
I
know
the
truth
It
is
not
me
It
is
you
You
are
the
monster
I
am
going
to
open
that
door
and
I
am
going
to
leave
with
Dr
Owens
If
you
try
to
stop
me
I
will
kill
you
Youll
soon
see
the
truth
Eleven
Ah
Is
this
legal
Actually
I
think
its
a
felony
Right
But
it
guarantees
one
thing
I
wont
miss
Hows
she
feeling
Light
But
durable
Deadly
But
reliable
Hear
me
now
There
will
be
no
more
retreating
from
Eddie
the
Banished
Hey

ready
for
battle
You

Battle
BAT
No
I
thought
I

good
one

Dustin

Hey
Sinclairs
How

Flip

damn
thumb
around
What

loose
Lucas
This
isnt
a
basketball
game
where
they
blow
the
whistle
when
your
shoes
fall
off
Okay
okay
for
the
record
my
shoes
never
fell
off
Okay
for
the
record
its
kinda
hard
for
your
shoes
to
fall
off
when
youre
riding
the
bench
Yet
for
some
reason
you
show
up
to
every
game
Mmm
except
the
one
that
mattered
Plus
Mom
and
Dad
forced
me
Bull
Mom
and
Dad
cant
force
you
to
do
shit
Well
even
though
youre
a
benchriding
loser
youre
still
my
brother
Just
the
facts
It
just
doesnt
make
sense
What
doesnt
make
sense
That
was
Dan
Shelter
He
graduated
like
two
years
ago
So
So
hes
in
college
Which
means
he
was
visiting
on
spring
break
Fast
Times
was
returned
like
I
dont
know
a
week
ago
Right
Unless
shes
got
some
horn
dog
brother
we
dont
know
about
Which
is
possible
Or
shes
just
really
into
Judge
Reinhold
Steve
Nah
What
I
dont
care
I
dont
understand
why
you
do
either
with
everything
thats
going
on
Honestly
this
feels
like
a
perfect
time
for
that
little
pull
of
the
rug
because
In
the
face
of
the
world
ending
the
stakes
of
my
love
life
feel
spectacularly
low
Yeah
I
mean
I
get
you
there
but
I
still
have
hope
Not
everything
has
a
happy
ending
Yeah
yeah
believe
me
I
know
Im
not
talking
about
failed
romance
I
just
I
have
this
terrible
gnawing
feeling
that
It
might
not
work
out
for
us
this
time
You
think
we
shouldnt
be
doing
this
I
think
were
mad
fools
the
lot
of
us
but
but
if
we
dont
stop
him
who
will
We
have
to
try
right

precaution

I
can
go
into
Maxs
She
can
carry
me
to
Vecna
I
can
piggyback
I
can
protect
her
From
One
Fight
him
from
here
Mind
fight
Righteous
Wait
so
you
actually
think
this
can
work
A
bathtub
would
help
Yeah
Gotta
be
clean
to
enter
the
mind
What
No
no
Its
a
sensory
deprivation
tank
It
helps
her
calm
down
and
focus
on
her
powers
Wait
we
we
just
passed
a
motel
Yeah
but
they
wont
have
enough
salt
Well
how
much
salt
are
we
talking
here
my
dudes
Well
depends
on
the
size
of
the
tub
but
a
lot
Does
pounds
suffice
You
know
a
place
that
has
pounds
of
salt
Lets
see
Yep
Mmhmm
Yep
Itll
work
What
will
work
I
know
a
magical
place
that
has
all
you
need
my
brave
little
super
powered
friend
That
mind
fight
is
on
Come
on
Vámonos
Lets
go
Pronto
Hey
I
think
we
got
something
Send
Ryan
I
dont
wanna
waste
any
more
time
with
bullshit
leads
I
dont
think
youll
wanna
send
Ryan
on
this
one
You
know
the
murder
house
on
More
head
Yeah
What
about
it
Okay
and
uh
who
exactly
was
this
mystery
woman
Not
sure
I
mean
she
wasnt
exactly
Miss
Talkative
You
know
I
spent
five
minutes
trying
to
convince
her
I
was
real
Im
supposed
to
be
dead
remember
Anyway
I
finally
get
around
to
halfconvincing
her
she
starts
to
open
up
a
little
then
says
that
shes
A
friend
of
the
docs
Great
so
am
I
Now
put
me
on
the
phone
with
him
Im
afraid
the
doc
is
indisposed
Indisposed
It
gets
worse
She
said
the
docs
with
the
girl
And
the
girl
went
off
to
fight
some
evil
in
Hawkins
Then
they
all
went
offgrid
The
doc
the
girl
everybody
The
girl
meaning
El
Yeah
it
has
to
be
This
is
your
daughter
American
Mmhmm
And
theyre
not
alone
Joyces
kids
are
with
em
Okay
I
I
see
the
mood
here
is
bleak
And
understandably
so
But
I
do
think
we
need
to
consider
the
very
real
possibility
that
this
mystery
woman
is
in
fact
KGB
And
shes
No
Shes
telling
the
truth
When
we
were
in
the
lab
those
particles
we
saw
they
were
alive
And
if
theyre
alive
that
means
a
gates
open
in
Hawkins
Gate
What
does
this
mean
It
means
we
have
to
go
home
right
now
What
is
taking
so
long
I
thought
you
said
he
was
close
Yeah
close
to
sabotaging
us
you
mean
We
think
hes
playing
us
again
So
put
a
goddamn
gun
to
his
head
And
then
what
He
just
spits
out
more
lies
Its
moot
anyway
If
your
kids
are
truly
in
some
kind
of
imminent
danger
even
if
we
were
to
leave
this
very
moment
we
wouldnt
make
it
in
time
The
earliest
wed
get
there
is
late
tomorrow
No
we
we
dont
have
to
make
it
back
Not
tonight
Whatever
this
evil
is
we
know
its
connected
to
the
hive
mind
And
now
we
know
part
of
that
hive
mind
is
in
Russia
So
we
dont
need
to
get
back
to
Hawkins
to
fight
it
All
we
need
is
to
destroy
those
particles
And
if
were
lucky
itll
hurt
it
enough
to
give
the
kids
the
upper
hand
Wait
time
out
Were
talking
about
the
particles
inside
the
prison
The
prison
that
we
just
narrowly
escaped
from
We
broke
out
We
can
break
back
in
Jim
The
entire
Soviet
army
is
looking
for
us
Sure
And
well
be
exactly
where
they
least
expect
All
right
There
is
a
fine
line
between
courage
and
stupidity
and
this
falls
very
far
on
the
side
of
stupid
This
is
Dirty
Dozen
stuff
Except
there
are
uh
four
of
us
Three
actually
Breaking
back
ins
gonna
be
easier
than
breaking
out
Which
is
why
we
need
an
airlift
This
is
where
you
come
in
I
dont
care
what
it
takes
You
get
Yuri
in
line
and
you
get
that
bird
in
the
air
On
it
Yu
Yuri
mentioned
something
about
a
flamethrower
right
Oh
yeah
Thisll
do
Thisll
do
just
fine
You
gotta
be
shitting
me
Trust
me
on
this
one
my
dudes
Surfs
up
my
dude
Uh
whoa
Nice
shirt
my
dude
Thanks
my
dude
Uh
listen
I
would
love
to
feed
a
fellow
Surfer
Boy
but

like
five
minutes
ago
so
no
more
pies
tonight
man
Thats
all
right
my
dude
Were
not
here
for
your
tasty
pies
You
see
this
weird
girl
behind
me
She
needs
a
tub
with
a
bunch
of
salt
so
we
can
enhance
her
psychic
power
so
she
can
save
the
world
from
this
super
bad
dude
But
to
make
this
salty
tub
we
require
your
kitchen
Ah
Well
its
just
uh
Im
supposed
to
meet
Chaz
at
Taco
Bell
in
like
ten
So
My
dude
Were
not
asking
you
to
help
for
free
You
ever
partake
in
Purple
Palm
Tree
Delight
Itll
make
all
your
troubles
float
away
Like
the
seed
pods
of
a
dandelion
in
the
wind
Firstever
mind
fight
held
in
a
pizza
dough
freezer
Pretty
rad
right
Not
bad
Not
bad
at
all
Now
for
the
fun
part
Jesus
Chr
Its
like
she
was
destined
for
an
alternate
dimension
What
do
you
say
Henderson
Are
you
ready
for
the
most
metal
concert
in
the
history
of
the
world
That
a
rhetorical
question
Lets
do
it
Uh
I
dont
mean
to
freak
anyone
out
but
I
swear
weve
seen
this
tree
before
Thats
impossible
That
would
suck
right
If
Vecna
destroyed
the
world
because
cause
we
got
lost
in
the
woods
Were
not
lost
Robin
Robin
hey
Watch
out
for
the
vines
Hive
mind
Remember
Thank
you
Uh
Dont
worry
about
her
Shes
just
stressed
You
know
scared
Yeah
Yeah
I
I
know
Its
just
Shes
a
super
klutz
She
did
tell
me
that
it
took
her
longer
to
walk
than
most
babies
so
I
really
shouldnt
laugh
When
I
was
a
baby
I
actually
crawled
backwards
Crawled
backwards
You
know
Id
push
with
my
hands
like
this
Beep
Beep
Always
in
reverse
you
know
Come
on
it
makes
sense
You
push
to
move
right
No
no
it
doesnt
make
sense
Well
it
did
to
my
tiny
little
Harrington
brain
That
is
until
I
reversed
my
baby
butt
down
a
flight
of
stairs
and
thumped
my
head
really
good
Yeah
Wow
That
explains
so
much
Yeah
I
think
it
kinda
does
I
think
like
right
out
of
the
gate
like
Im
super
confident
But
Im
also
like
an
idiot
Which
is
just
I
mean
its
a
brutal
combination
But
I
mean
the
good
news
is
I
get
a
big
enough
thump
on
my
head
I
can
change
you
know
I
can
learn
I
can
crawl
forward
Listen
I
guess
what
Im
trying
to
say
in
a
really
stupid
roundabout
way
is
um
is
thank
you
Thank
me
Yeah
For
For
giving
my
head
the
biggest
thump
of
its
life
two
years
ago
I
needed
it
Its
changed
my
life
And
now
Im
crawling
forward
Slowly
I
just
wonder
sometimes
You
know
if
some
other
girl
had
given
me
a
proper
thump
before
wed
met
would
things
have
been
different
Like
if
we
were
meeting
together
for
the
first
time
right
now
part
of
me
I
dunno
part
of
me
thinks
we
wouldve
made
it
Steve
Remember
the
dream
I
told
you
about
About
the
Winnebago
Seeing
the
country
with
my
six
lil
nuggets
Its
all
true
Every
last
word
But
I
left
one
part
out
Its
the
most
important
part
Youre
there
Youve
always
been
there
Hey
guys
You
guys
Awesome
news
Looks
like
we
werent
going
the
wrong
way
after
all
Come

Lets
go
Okay
Ro
Slow
down
Ro
Robin
Erica
Where
are
the
guards
Maybe
thisll
be
easier
than
we
thought
I
dont
know
Jim
I
got
a
bad
feeling
about
this
I
have
a
question
What
if
I
dont
want
to
answer
Have
you
always
been
a
coward
Yuri
Ismaylov
is
many
things
you
traitor
But
he
is
No
coward
If
that
is
so
why
do
you
continue
to
stall
What
do
I
owe
these
Americans
Nothing
This
isnt
just
about
America
smuggler
They
have
warned
us
of
a
great
evil
in
the
world
An
evil
that
does
not
rest
that
does
not
respect
borders
After
it
has
consumed
everything
in
their
land
it
will
come
for
us
For
our
families
For
our
Motherland
You
saw
it
with
your
own
eyes
You
know
it
to
be
true
And
yet
you
continue
to
play
tricks
I
was
told
the
Peanut
Butter
Smuggler
was
once
a
great
man
Before
he
lost
his
way
to
drink
and
cards
That
he
led
his
men
to
victory
over
the
Chinese
in
Damansky
Is
it
true
It
is
true
That
hero
where
is
he
now
Because
I
do
not
see
him
Come
on
Come

Okay

Okay

hopefully
this
blocks
out
any
peripheral
light
right
And
its
totally
dark

one
more
important
question

You

before
the
cops
and
The
whole
world
went
to
shit
I
I
guess

Surfs

Okay

Do
you
remember
that
time
you
told
me
you
had
a
Lego
stuck
up
your
nose
What
Yeah
Like
it
was
like
a
It
was
like
a
construction
guy
Youd
call
him
Larry
Come

You
dont
remember
He
had
the
high
viz
jacket
and
removable
hat
Yeah
Vaguely
Well
I

it
like
it
was
yesterday
Man
I
was
I
was
freaked
Cause
Cause
this
Larry
I
mean
Larry
was
way
way
up
there
I
dont
even
know
how
you
got
him
that
far
up
I
had
to
do
surgery
I
I
had
to
get
tweezers
to
pull
him
out
Bull
No
No
no
I
swear
on
my
life
I
dont
know
I
just
I
feel
like
you
used
to
come
to
me
more
for
help
Or
to
just
talk
you
know
Cause
like
you
dont
do
that
anymore
Not
like
before
A
lot
of
that
is
probably
my
fault
This
last
year
I
know
Ive
been
distant
Or
stoned
Or
stoned
Yeah
But
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
And
thats
me
dealing
with
my
own
shit
Hiding
from
my
own
problems
The
truth
is
I
miss
talking
to
you
I
like
really
miss
it
And
I
think
right
now
we
need
to
talk
more
than
ever
Because
things
are
getting
just
complicated
A
lot
more
complicated
than
Legos
up
the
nose
you
know
I
just
I
dont
want
you
to
forget
that
Im
here
And
Ill
always
be
here
No
matter
what
Because
youre
my
brother
And
I
love
you
And
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
okay
absolutely
nothing
that
will
ever
change
that
You
got
that
Yeah
And
Im
always
here
for
you
too
I
know
I
know
you
are
Come
here
Its
gonna
be
okay
Yeah
Yeah
I
think
its
ready
All
right
Its
time
Wild
I
found
them
Theyre
carrying
a
light
A
blue
light
What
are
you
waiting
for
asshole
Hmm
Im
right
here
Im
right
here
OkayEl
whats
going
on
Its
not
working
What
Whats
not
working
Maxs
plan
I
know
you
can
hear
me
I
know
you
can
read
my
thoughts
Even
the
worst
ones
Maybe
mostly
the
worst
ones
I
thought
about
what
you
said
About
how
I
wanted
my
brother
to
die
I
thought
you
were
just
trying
to
upset
me
To
anger
me
But
you
werent
were
you
You
were
just
telling
the
truth
Billy
he
made
my
life
living
hell
Every
chance
he
got
So
sometimes
When
I
would
lie
in
bed
at
night
I
would
I
would
pray
I
would
pray
that
something
would
happen
to
him
Something
awful
I
knew
that
he
drove
too
fast
so
I
would
imagine
him
crashing
Dying
in
that
stupid
car
I
just
I
wanted
him
out
of
my
life
Forever
I
wanted
him
to
disappear
The
day
that
he
died
I
think
thats
why
I
just
stood
there
Watched
Not
because
I
was
scared
or
weak
But
because
I
didnt
know
if
he
deserved
to
be
saved
And
Ive
tried
to
forgive
myself
Ive
tried
but
I
cant
I
cant
So
now
Now
when
I
lie
in
bed
at
night
I
pray
that
something
will
happen
to
me
That
something
terrible
will
happen
to
me
So
thats
why
Im
here
Because
I
just
want
you
to
take
me
away
And
I
want
you
To
make
me
disappear
Is
that
all
true
You
wanted
Billy
to
die
Why
are
you
talking
You

have
thoughts
like
that
about
me
What

takes
you
Maybe

for
the
best
In
fact
Im
glad
its
going
to
be
you
You
will
be
the
chosen
one
The
fourth
The
final
sacrifice

going
to

The

You

Then

Chrissy
at
Eddies
trailer
She
was
buying
drugs
Liar
Okay
Okay
Chrissy
She
was
seeing
things
Terrible
things
Things
Vecna
forced
her
to
see
She
was
scared
No
She
just
needed
help
Thats
how
I
know
youre
lying
If
Chrissy
was
scared
if
if
Chrissy
wanted
help
she
wouldve
come
to
me
Not
Eddie
Not
that
freak
Never
Youre
wrong
about
Eddie
No
But
I
was
wrong
about
you
I
never
shouldve
let
you
in
the
door
And
I
never
should
have
knocked
I
thought
I
wanted
to
be
like
you
Popular
Normal
But
it
turns
out
normals
just
a
raging
psychopath
You
have
five
seconds
to
wake
her
up
Four
Three
Hey
Hey
Crit
hit
No
No
You
are
brave
Maxine
Much
braver
than
your
brother
But
in
the
end
You
are
weak
and
fragile
just
like
him
Like
all
the
rest
of
them
And
you
will
break
You
Hi
Come
get
me
you
sons
of
bitches
Screw
it
I
didnt
know
what
to
do
so
I
I
I
ran
away
I
just
ran
and
I
left
her
there
I
mean
look
at
us
We
are
not
heroes
Shit
Max
are
you
okay
Huh
Are
you
okay
Yeah
Are
you
Are
you
real
Di
Did
I
make
you
Im

How
I
piggybacked
from
a
pizza
dough
freezer
What
Uh
Stay
back
If
you
touch
her
again
I
will
kill
you
again
Is
that
what
you
did
Hmm
Did
you
kill
me
I
am
so
glad
you
are
here
Eleven
This
Is
going
to
be
beautiful
So
beautiful
And
its
all
thanks
to
you
Shes
fighting
him
Eddie
Eddie
Eddie
Eddie
Come
on
Before
I
kill
you
I
want
you
to
watch
Papa
is
dead
I
know
what
he
did
to
you
You
were
different
Like
me
And
he
hurt
you
He
made
you
Into
this
He
is
the
monster
Henry
Not
you
Not
you
Youre
right
You
and
I
we
are
different
And
Papa
did
hurt
me
But
he
was
no
monster
He
was
just
a
man
An
ordinary
mediocre
man
That
is
why
he
sought
greatness
in
others
In
you
And
me
Hmm
But
in
the
end
He
could
not
control
us
He
could
not
shape
us
He
could
not
change
us
Do
you
not
see
Eleven
He
did
not
make
me
into
this
You
did
At
first
I
believed
you
had
sent
me
to
my
death
To
purgatory
But
I
was
wrong
I
was
somewhere
new
I
became
an
explorer
An
explorer
of
a
realm
unspoiled
by
mankind
I
saw
so
many
things
And
one
day
I
found
the
most
extraordinary
thing
of
all
Something
that
would
change
everything
I
saw
a
means
to
realize
my
potential
To
transcend
my
human
form
To
become
the
predator
I
was
always
born
to
be
It
was
It
was
you
Always
you
All
I
needed
was
someone
to
open
the
door
And
you
did
that
for
me
Without
even
realizing
it
Didnt
you
And
when
you
did
realize
you
chose
to
resist
So
I
sought
a
means
to
open
my
own
doors
I
sought
Your
power
All
this
time
weve
been
building
it
For
you
So
dont
you
see
Once
again
you
have
freed
me
No
You
dont
have
to
do
this
You
can
still
stop
this
It
is
over
Eleven
Your
friends
have
lost
No
Eddie
There
is
nothing
Nothing
you
can
do
to
stop
this
now
Hawkins
will
burn
and
fall
And
the
rest
of
this
senseless
broken
world
And
I
will
be
there
Lucas
I
will
be
there
to
pick
up
the
pieces
when
it
does
Lucas
And
remake
it
into
something
beautiful
There
was
a
time
when
I
had
hoped
to
have
you
by
my
side
But
now
I
just
want
you
to
watch
Dont
be
afraid
Try
and
stay
very
still
No
It
will
all
be
over
soon

I
Its

not
Ive
never
felt
that
way
Never
But
I
am
scared
that
one
day
youll
realize
you
dont
need
me
anymore
And
I
thought
if
I
said
how
I
felt
it
would
somehow
make
that
day
hurt
more
But
the
truth
is
El
I
dont
know
how
to
live
without
you
I
feel
like
my
life
started
that
day
we
found
you
in
the
woods
You
were
wearing
that
yellow
Bennys
Burgers
Tshirt
And
it
was
so
big
it
almost
swallowed
you
whole
And
I
knew
right
then
and
there
in
that
moment
that
I
loved
you
And
Ive
loved
you
every
day
since
I
love
you
on
your
good
days
I
love
you
on
your
bad
days
I
love
you
with
your
powers
without
your
powers
I
love
you

you
are
Youre

superhero
And

You

But

Hi
Hi
Max
wanted
to
have
a
sleepover
Which
one
This
is
Wonder
Woman
AKA
Princess
Diana
Not
Hopper
Not
Mike
You
Holy
shit
This
is
insane
Is
this
really
gonna
work
See
Whatd
I
tell
you
Theres
more
to
life
than
stupid
boys
Against
the
rules
We
make
our
own
rules
Its
been
less
than
hours
since
a
magnitude
earthquake
rocked
the
quaint
town
of
Hawkins
miles
outside
of
Indianapolis
in
an
event
that
seismologists
are
calling
a
natural
disaster
of
nearunprecedented
scale
The
death
toll
now
stands
at
But
with
hundreds
more
filling
Roane
County
hospitals
and
many
more
still
missing
officials
expect
those
numbers
to
rise
Go
This
way
This
way
Lets
go
This
is
only
the
latest
tragedy
to
befall
this
oncesafe
town
Most
recently
a
string
of
high
school
students
were
killed
in
a
series
of
ritualistic
murders
which
have
been
linked
to
a
local
satanic
cult
known
as
Hellfire
Eddie
Munson
the
leader
of
this
cult
and
prime
suspect
in
the
murders
has
been
missing
since
the
earthquake
and
is
presumed
dead
But
this
offers
little
comfort
to
the
people
of
Hawkins
who
are
scared
angry
and
searching
for
answers
Why
their
town
What
have
they
done
to
deserve
so
much
suffering
A
growing
chorus
believes
the
two
recent
tragedies
are
linked
claiming
the
Munson
murders
opened
a
doorway
between
worlds
A
doorway
they
say
into
hell
itself
Are
you
hearing
this
Theyre
now
calling
it
a
doorway
into
hell
Great
More
hysteria
Just
what
we
need
Well
its
the
news
Now
indistinguishable
from
the
tabloids
Hey
Nance
I
found
some
more
of
your
old
stuff
in
the
attic
Mr
Rabbit
Its
okay
if
you
wanna
save
him
you
know
No
hell
be
more
loved
in
a
new
home
Someone
order
a
pizza
Pizza
Mom
Hey
You
are
never
going
on
vacation
again
you
hear
me
In
fact
you
can
forget
about
college
You
are
staying
right
here
Are
you
okay
Yeah
Yeah
Im
okay
But
Jonathan
This
isnt
an
earthquake
I
know
I
know
a
lot
more
than
you
think
How
Weve
been
trying
to
call
you
I
know
I
know
Im
sorry
We
just
couldnt
risk
contact
We
couldnt
risk
contact
Hey
hey
Ill
tell
you
everything
okay
Okay
I
promise
But
for
now
Im
just
glad
youre
safe
Wheres
Lucas
Hes
at
the
hospital
Was
he
hurt
No
No
hes
Oh
God
You
dont
know
He
opened
his
eyes
and
further
words
died
in
his
throat
He
forgot
about
the
need
to
sick
up
that
horrible
parody
of
wine
He
forgot
about
his
mother
and
Uncle
Morgan
and
his
father
and
almost
everything
else
Speedy
was
gone
The
graceful
arcs
of
the
roller
coaster
against
the
sky
were
gone
He
could
feel
the
hair
stirring
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
could
feel
a
goofedup
grin
pulling
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
Speedy
Im
here
my
God
Im
here
in
the
territories
Oh
my
God
Weve
been
calling
you
guys
like
crazy
I
know
We
came
as
soon
as
we
heard
Im
sorry
Do
they
know
When
she
will
wake
No
They
say
she
might
not
Her
heart
stopped
For
over
a
minute
She
died
I
I
mean
clinically
but
Then
she
came
back
The
doctors
dont
know
how
They
say
its
a
miracle
Im
here
Max
Hi
Hi
Uh
so
these
are
blankets
and
sheets
And
some
some
clothes
and
and
some
kids
toys
Wow
Its
already
so
organized
We
appreciate
that
Do
you
want
a
tax
receipt
for
it
Um
No
I
dont
think
that
we
need
one
Thank
you
though
But
is
there
anything
else
that
we
can
do
to
help
Okay
then
we
sort
by
age
Weve
got
infants
girls
boys
men
women
Oh
if
anything
is
in
too
bad
shape
we
really
dont
want
that
I
found
another

ultimately
its
bordering
on
