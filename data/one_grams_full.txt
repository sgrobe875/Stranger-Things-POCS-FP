:
MIKE
We
were
wondering
if
you
had
time
to
?
talk
-
We
have
some
.
questions
-
A
lot
of
.
questions
,
So
you
know
how
in
,
Cosmos
Carl
Sagan
talks
about
other
?
dimensions
,
Like
beyond
our
?
world
,
Yeah
.
sure
.
Theoretically
,
Right
.
theoretically
,
So
,
theoretically
how
do
we
travel
?
there
You
guys
have
been
thinking
about
Hugh
’
Everetts
-
ManyWorlds
,
Interpretation
’
havent
?
you
,
Well
,
basically
there
are
parallel
.
universes
Just
like
our
,
world
but
just
infinite
variations
of
.
it
Which
means
’
theres
a
world
out
there
where
none
of
this
tragic
stuff
ever
.
happened
,
Yeah
’
thats
not
what
’
were
talking
.
about
-
.
Oh
-
We
were
thinking
of
more
of
an
evil
,
dimension
like
the
Vale
of
.
Shadows
You
know
the
Vale
of
?
Shadows
An
echo
of
the
Material
,
Plane
where
necrotic
and
shadow
—
magic
:
MIKE
,
Yeah
.
exactly
If
that
did
,
exist
a
place
like
the
Vale
of
,
Shadows
how
would
we
travel
?
there
-
.
Theoretically
-
.
MR
:
CLARK
.
.
.
Well
.
.
.
Picture
an
.
.
.
acrobat
standing
on
a
.
tightrope
,
Now
the
tightrope
is
our
.
dimension
And
our
dimension
has
.
rules
You
can
move
,
forwards
or
.
backwards
,
But
what
.
.
.
if
right
next
to
our
,
acrobat
there
is
a
?
flea
,
Now
the
flea
can
also
travel
back
and
,
forth
just
like
the
.
acrobat
-
?
Right
-
.
Right
’
Heres
where
things
get
really
.
interesting
The
flea
can
also
travel
this
.
.
.
way
along
the
side
of
the
.
rope
He
can
even
.
.
.
go
underneath
the
.
rope
-
:
BOYS
Upside
.
down
-
.
Exactly
But
’
were
not
the
,
flea
’
were
the
.
acrobat
In
this
,
metaphor
,
yes
’
were
the
.
acrobat
So
we
’
cant
go
upside
?
down
.
No
,
Well
is
there
any
way
for
the
acrobat
to
get
to
the
Upside
?
Down
.
.
.
Well
’
youd
have
to
create
a
massive
amount
of
.
energy
More
than
humans
are
currently
capable
of
,
creating
mind
,
you
to
open
up
some
kind
of
tear
in
time
and
,
space
and
.
.
.
then
you
create
a
.
doorway
-
Like
a
?
gate
-
.
Sure
Like
a
.
gate
-
But
,
again
this
is
—
all
-
.
Theoretical
.
.
.
But
but
what
if
this
gate
already
?
existed
,
Well
if
it
,
did
.
.
.
I
I
think
’
wed
.
know
It
would
disrupt
,
gravity
the
magnetic
,
field
our
.
environment
,
Heck
it
might
even
swallow
us
up
.
whole
Science
is

neat

its
not

I

you

just
’

it

nothing

you
ask

this
But
’
thats
got
to
be
what
.
happened

,
Otherwise
’
howd
Will
get
,
there
?
right
-
.
Right
What
we
want
to
know

is
do
you
know
where
the
gate
?
is
Then
how
do
you
know
about
the

I
need

What
Your

compasses
All
of
your
,
compasses
right
!
now
’
Whats
exciting
about
?
this
-
,
Well
’
theyre
all
facing
,
north
?
right
-
,
Yeah
?
so
-
,
Well
’
thats
not
true
.
north
-
What
do
you
?
mean
I
mean
exactly
what
I
just
.
said
’
Thats
not
true
.
north
Are
you
both
seriously
this
?
dense
The
sun
rises
in
the
,
east
and
it
sets
in
the
.
west
?
Right
Which
means
’
thats
true
.
north
So
what
’
youre
saying
is
the
compasses
are
.
broken
[
]
SIGHS
Do
you
even
understand
how
a
compass
?
works
-
Do
you
see
a
battery
pack
in
?
this
-
.
No
,
No
you
’
.
dont
Because
it
’
doesnt
need
.
one
The
’
needles
naturally
drawn
to
the
’
Earths
magnetic
North
.
Pole
So
’
whats
wrong
with
?
them
,
Well
’
thats
what
I
’
couldnt
figure
,
out
but
then
I
.
remembered
You
can
change
the
direction
of
a
compass
with
a
.
magnet
If
’
theres
the
presence
of
a
more
powerful
magnetic
,
field
the
needle
deflects
to
that
.
power
And
then
I
remembered
what
.
Mr
Clarke
.
said
The
gate
would
have
so
much
—
power
It
could
disrupt
the
electromagnetic
.
field
.
Exactly
,
Meaning
if
we
follow
the
’
compasses
.
.
.
north
They
should
lead
us
to
the
.
gate

The
harm
in

that

forgiveness

permission
And
if
this

Tom

what

again
This

a

Its
a

coil
wrapped
around
a

core
and
when
electricity
passes
through

.

it
It
creates
an

field

for

part

Shall

we

Yeah

I

there

you

Field
Pretty
,
neato

And
this

affects
any
charged
object
in

-
Just
like
my

Just
like
your

,
Okay
why
is
nothing

happening
,
Oh
because
our
field
is

stable
,
But
if
we
reduce
the

.

current

.
.
How
The
magnetic

tried
to
orient
according
to
the

field
.
.
.
but
,
No
,
no
,
no
I
,
mean
how
is
this
happening
at
my

house
You
want
my
honest
?
opinion
One
of
your
kiddos
got
up
in
the
middle
of

bumped
into

Uh

there

Coincidence
But
what
.
.
.
if
'
its
?
not
.
.
.
Well
-
,
Theoreticallyspeaking
I
suppose
some
large
version
of
this
AC
transformer
could
.
exist
A
machine
of
some
.
kind
A
?
machine
,
But
in
order
to
reach
your
house
and
,
downtown
,
gosh
that
would
take
billions
of
volts
of
electricity
and
cost
tens
of
millions
of

dollars

it
is

possible

The

,
"
long
the
silver
cat

in

I
,
mean
it

.

just
it
just
'

right

right

,
Honestly
I

news
How
is
this
great

news
I
,
mean
so
much
for

heroes

'
Its
total
.
nonsense
-
'
Its
not

nonsense
'
Its
too
.
specific
'
Its
obviously
a
.
code
-
What
do
you
,
mean
a
?
code
-
Like
a
super
secret
spy

code
-
'
Thats
a
total
.
stretch
-
I
'
dont
,
know
is
?
it
'
Youre
buying
into
?
this
,
Listen
just
for
,
kicks
'
lets
entertain
the
possibility
that
it
is
a
secret
Russian
.
transmission
'
Whatd
you
think
they
were
gonna
,
say
"
Fire
the
warhead
at
"
?
noon
-
.
Exactly
-
And
my
translation
is
.
correct
I
know
that
for
,
sure
.
.
.
so
"
The
silver
cat
.
"
feeds
W
hy
would
anyone
talk
like
that
unless
'
theyre
trying
to
mask
-
the
meaning
of
their
?
message
-
.
Exactly
Why
would
anyone
mask
the
true
meaning
of
their
message
unless
the
message
was
somehow
?
sensitive
.
Exactly
-
So
I
guess
that
confirms
your
.
suspicion
-
Evil
.
Russians
I
'
cant
believe
'
Im
about
to
agree
with
this
strange
,
child
,
but
,
yeah
totally
evil
.
Russians
So
how
do
we
crack
?
it
,
Well
I
guess
we
translate
the
rest
and
hopefully
a
pattern
.
emerges
A
.
pattern
,
Right
like
maybe
"
silver
"
cat
is
a
meeting
?
place
Or
a
.
person
Or
a
.
weapon
'
Its
probably
gonna
take
a
super
genius
to
crack
,
it
.
.
.
but

Wheres

in
the
.
night
It
lost
its
.
magnetism

-
And
the
same
exact
thing
happened
at
my
house
the
day
.
before
-
.
Wow

And
I
,
thought
"
,
Okay
'
thats

Why

all
these
magnets
suddenly
losing
their
?
magnetism

Scott
-
Scott
.
Clarke
-
Your
'
childs
science
?
teacher
'
Hes
pretty
,
brilliant
.
actually
And
I
asked
,
him
"
How
is
this
?
"
happening
And
he
built
this
magnetic
field
using
an
AC
transformer
and
plugging
it
into
a
.
solenoid
.
.
.
And
And
with
that
,
solenoid
which
.
.
.
basically
Slow
,
down
slow
.

I
just
want

this
exactly
,
right

demagnetize
some
of
the
,
magnets
and
he
.
.
.
thinks
I
'
dont

what
Scott
!
thinks
He
thinks
that
a
-
largescale
magnetic
field
could
be
built
using
some
sort
of
machine
.
.
.
or
or
experimental
.
technology
'
Hes
,
brilliant
'
isnt

trust
By

the

of

lot
.
facts

Facts
,
So
while
'
were
,
here
'
lets
go
over
the
.
facts
Fact
:
one
you
disobeyed
a
direct
order
to
stop
pursuing
this
.
story
:
Two
you
falsely
identified
yourselves
as
,
reporters
repeatedly
lying
to
an
elderly
.
woman
:
Three
you
broke
into
her
,
home
committing
.
trespass
:
Four
she
almost
died
en
route
to
the
.
hospital
She
'
wouldve
died
if
we
'
hadnt
shown
!
up
Whatever
disease
that
rat
had
clearly
passed
to
.
.
.
her
!
Five
.
Mrs
Driscoll
is
a
paranoid
.
schizophrenic
You
'
didnt
know
,
that
did
?
you
.
.
.
Now
-
diseasecarrying
?
rats
The
second
coming
of
the
?
plague
Does
this
sound
credible
to
,
you
or
perhaps
does
this
sound
more
like
the
delusions
of
a
very
sick
old
?
lady
-
I
'
didnt
know
.
that
-
Her
'
familys
.
furious
So
,
furious
in
,
fact
'
theyve
threatened
.
litigation
-
?
Litigation
-
'
Thats
.
crazy
For
,
once
we
.
agree
This
is
.
crazy
In
,
fact
in
my
entire
professional
,
career
'
Ive
never
dealt
with
anything
quite
like
.
it
But
,
hopefully
,
hopefully
'
youve
learned
something
valuable
.
here
'
Youve
.
.
.
learned
how
in
the
,
workplace
in
the
real
,
world
there
are
consequences
to
your
.
actions
Which
brings
me
to
my
sixth
and
.
.
.
final
.
fact
'
Youre
.
fired
Both
of
.
you
I
'
didnt

it
was
anything
at
.
first
I
,

I
think
I
just
'
didnt
want
to
believe
.
it
The
first
time
I
felt
it
was
at
Day
of
the
.
Dead
-
Power
went
out
that
,
night
.
too
-
And
then
I
felt
it
again
at
the
field
near
the
Nelson
farm
the
next
.
day
Then
again
yesterday
outside
Castle
.
Byers
!
Will

does
it
feel

almost
.
.
.

drop
on
a
roller
?
coaster
-
.
Sure

.
Yeah

.
.

at
,
once
.

about

system
for

that

cargo
It
all
comes
into
the
mall
like
any
old

delivery
And
then
they
load
it
up
onto
those
trucks
and
'
nobodys
the
.
wiser
You
think
they
built
this
whole
mall
so
they
could
transport
that
green
?
poison
I
very
seriously
doubt
'
its
something
as
boring
as
.
poison
'
Its
gotta
be
much
more
,
valuable
like
promethium

something

the

out

also
precisely
the
reason

she
is
conspiring

Do

.
Mrs
'
Clicks
sophomore
history
?
class
?
What
.
Mrs
-
.
ClickityClackity
'
Thats
what
us
band
dweebs
called
.
her
It
was
first
,
period
Tuesdays
and
,
Thursdays
so
you
were
always
.
late
And
you
always
had
the
same
.
breakfast
,
Bacon
,
egg
and
cheese
on
a
sesame
.
bagel
I
sat
behind
you
two
days
a
week
for
a
.
year
Mister
.
Funny
Mister
.
Cool
The
King
of
Hawkins
High
.
himself
Do
you
even
remember
me
from
that
?
class
Of
course
you
'
.
dont
You
were
a
real
,
asshole
you
know
?
that
,
Yeah
I
.
know
But
it
'
didnt
even
.
matter
It
'
didnt
matter
that
you
were
an
.
ass
I
was
.
.
.
still
obsessed
with
.
you
Even
though
all
of
us
losers
pretend
to
be
above
it
,
all
we
still
just
wanna
be
.
.
.
popular
,
accepted
.
normal
If
it
makes
you
feel
any
,
better
having
those
things
'
isnt
all
that
.
great
.
Seriously
It
just
baffles
.
me
Everything
that
people
tell
you
is
,
important
everything
that
people
say
you
should
care
,
about
'
its
all
.
.
.
just
.
Bullshit
But
I
guess
you
gotta
mess
up
to
figure
things
,
out
?
right
I
hope
.
so
I
feel
like
my
whole
life
has
.
.
.
been
one
big
.
error
.
Yep
At
least
it
'
cant
get
any
more
messed
up
than
.
this
You

know
I
wish
'
Id
known
you
in
'
Clicks
.
class
-
?
Yeah

the
.
class
Maybe

here
'
Id
be
on
my
way
to
college
right
.
now
And
I
would
have
no
idea
that
there
were
evil
Russians
beneath
our
,
feet
and
I
would
be
happily
slinging
ice
cream
with
some
other
.
schmuck
Gotta
,
say
,
though
I
liked
being
your
.
schmuck
It
was
fun
while
it
.
lasted
It
.
was
Where
were
you
two
?
going
Try
telling
the
truth

,
time

where
we
.

him

.
"
Suzie

Wait

I
care
about

much
And
I
know
that
you
care
about
each
other
very

much
And
'
thats
why
'
its
important
that
we
set
these
boundaries

,
forward

we
can
build
an
.
.
.
environment
where
we
all
.

feel

.

comfortable

.

trusted

.
.

to
sharing
our

"
feelings
.
Feelings
.
Feelings
.
Jesus
The
truth
,
is
for
so
,
long
'
Id
forgotten
what
those
even
.
were
'
Ive
been
stuck
in
one
,
place
in
a
,
cave
you
might
.
say
A
,
deep
dark
.
cave
And
,
then
I
left
some
Eggos
out
in
the
,
woods
and
you
came
into
my
life
.
.
.
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
,
time
I
started
to
feel
things
.
again
I
started
to
feel
.
happy
,
But
,
lately
I
guess
'
Ive
been
.
.
.
feeling
distant
from
.
you
Like
'
.
.
.
youre
'
youre
pulling
away
from
me
or
.
something
I
miss
playing
board
games
every
,
night
making
-
tripledecker
Eggo
extravaganzas
at
,
sunrise
watching
westerns
together
before
we
doze
.
off
But
I
know
'
youre
getting
.
older
.
Growing
.
Changing
And
I
.
.
.
guess
if
'
Im
being
really
,
honest
'
thats
what
scares
.
me
I
'
dont
want
things
to
.
change
,
So
I
think
maybe
'
thats
why
I
came
in
,
here
to
try
to
.
.
.
maybe
stop
that
.
change
To
turn
back
the
.
clock
To
make
things
go
back
to
how
they
.
were
But
I
know
'
thats
.
naive
'
Its
.
.
.
just
not
how
life
.
works
'
Its
.
moving
Always
,
moving
whether
you
like
it
or
.
not
,
And
,
yeah
sometimes
'
its
.
painful
Sometimes
'
its
.
sad
And
.
.
.
sometimes
'
its
.
surprising
.
Happy
,
So
you
know
?
what
Keep
on
growing
,
up

Dont
let
me

that
Emotions
can
make
it
speed
up
or
slow
.
down
We
are
all
time
travelers
if
you
think
about
.
it
For
,
example
this
week
is
going
very
.
fast
I
think
because
I
am
so
.
busy
I
have
to
make
something
called
a
visual
.
aid
I
hope
.
Mrs
Gracey
will
give
me
an

A
I
can
send
you

previous
edition
as
a
loaner
to

the
product
before
committing
to
purchasing

it
Some
exciting
.
news
Joyce
got
an
amazing
new
.
job
She
gets
to
work
at
.
home
,
Yeah
'
…
Im
'
Im
not
a

robot
You
do
realize
,
that
'
dont
?
you
She
says
she
loves
the
"
.
"
freedom
.
Prick
Will
is
painting
a
,
lot
but
…
he
he
'
wont
show
me
what
'
hes
working
.
on
Maybe
it
is
for
a
.
girl
I
think
there
is
someone
he
,
likes
because
he
has
been
acting
.
weird
Jonathan
is
acting
weird
.
also
I
think
he
is
just
nervous
about
.
college
He
is
still
waiting
for
his
big
.
letter
I
hope
he
and
Nancy
get
to
go
.
together
Damn
.
it
But
I
'
dont
know
how
'
hell
get
to
college
because
his
car
is
still
.
broken
His
funny
friend
Argyle
has
been
taking
us
to
.
school
His
hair
is
longer
than
.
mine
And
he
and
Jonathan
like
to
smoke
smelly
plants
.
together
Jonathan
says
the
plants
are
super
safe
because
they
come
from
the
,
earth
but
to
not
tell
.
Joyce
?
Me
I
am
twice
as
happy

keep
spilling

out

'
its

my
my

ProfessorBrantley
,
Yeah
I
know

Larry
Quite
,
well

actually
,
Eh
you

what
they

say
"
Those
who

"

,
Uh
,
yes
,
yes
'
thats
actually
why

here

,

we

only
learn
so
much
in
a

classroom
.
Mmm
And
'
Im
sympathetic
to
your
,
struggle
.
truly
But
there
is
a
protocol
to
visiting
a
patient
like
.
Victor
You
put
in
a
request
and
 
thenundergo
a
screening
,
process
at
which
point
the
board
will
make
a
.
decision
I
can
see
'
youre
.
disappointed
But
'
Im
more
than
happy
to
give
you
a
.
tour
Perhaps
you
can
even
speak
to
some
patients
in
our
-
lowsecurity
.
wing
And
'
…
wed
we
would
love
.
that
'
Its
just
,
that
…
um
…
our
thesis
is
due
next
.
month
And
'
youre
out
of

time
Whose
fault
is
?
that
.
Ours
.
Absolutely
And
I
do
.
.
.
apologize
'
Dont
,
apologize
.
Ruth
Screw
.
that
The
fact
,
is
we
did
put
in
a
request
months
ago
and
were
.
denied
And
then
we
reapplied
and
were
denied
.
again
And
coming
here
was
our
-
lastditch
effort
to
save
our
.
thesis
And
I
…
really
I
'
cant
breathe
in
this

thing
,
Well
,
Rose
maybe
'
youd
like
to
go
outside
and
get
some

air
-
Maybe
I
,
should

Ruth

-
.
Mmhmm
Because
'
Im
starting
to
think
this
whole
thing
is
a
colossal

mistake
'
Im
breaking
out
in
a
.
rash
My
boobs

hurt
And
'
Ill
tell
you
the
,
truth

Anthony
May
I
call
you
?
Anthony
These
'
arent
my

clothes
I
borrowed
them
because
I
wanted
you

seriously

field
They
just
'

dont
We

But
can
I
tell
you
a

story

,
I
was
at
summer

camp
And
my
counselor
Drew
told
me
and
everyone
in
Cabin
C
the
true
story
of
the
Victor
Creel

Massacre
And
 
littlePetey
…
McHew
You
know
,
Petey
,
right
?
Ruth
…
Of
Of

Yeah
Little
Petey
McHew
started
sobbing
right
there
on
the

spot

Fullon
.
hyperventilating
The
other
campers
'
couldnt
sleep
for
.
weeks
I
'
couldnt
,
either
but
not
'
cause
I
was
.
scared
Because
I
was
obsessed
with
the
,
question
"
What
would
drive
a
human
being
to
commit
such
unimaginable
?
"
acts
Other
kids
wanted
to
be

astronauts
basketball
,
players
rock

stars
But
I
wanted
to
be
.
you
I
wanted
to
be
.
you
,
So
forgive
me
if
'
Ill
now
try
anything
in
my
,
power
including
wearing
this
ridiculous
,
outfit
if
I
might
get
to
speak
to
the
man
that
ignited
my
passion
and
learn
a
little
more
about
how
his
,
twisted
but
'
lets
face
,
it
totally
fascinating
mind

works

So
,
yes
we

the
official

paperwork

tell
me
that

Petey
McHew

wouldnt

gotten
an
audience
with
Victor
in
moments
if

asked

politely

you

I
both

ridiculous

that
was

so

Im
just
going

So
much
has
happened

We
had
a

baby
and
she

was

um
She
was
born
.
healthy
She
was
,
perfect
you

Sara
And
then
she

died
Blood
'
pressures

dropping
It

wasnt
an
easy

death
…
She

Suffered
I
knew
the
,
risks
but
,
I
…
um
I
hid
.
them
And
then
Diane
left
.
me
She
'
didnt
blame
.
me
Not
with
.
words
After
,
that
I
was
…
just
I
just
hid
myself
in
drugs
and
.
alcohol
And
then
people
started
coming
into
my
.
life
This
girl
,
El
and
Joyce
just
,
happened
and
I
told
myself
they
needed
.
me
But
that
'
wasnt
.
true
'
Thats
a
.
lie
They
'
didnt
need
.
me
I
needed
.
them
I
needed

them
You
were
,
right
what
you
said
last
.
night
I
knew
the
,
risks
breaking
out
of
,
here
but
I
did
it
.
anyway
The
minute
I
sent
for
,
Joyce
the
minute
I
sent
for
,
her
I
sentenced
her
to
.
death
Just
like
I
did
with
.
Sara
Everyone
I
,
love
I
.
hurt

See
I

here
Can
I
help

you
We

Happy
to

Martin
Hawkins

running
out
of

time
I
understand
the
stakes
quite
.
well
Sometimes
I
wonder
if
you
really
.
do
Or
maybe
'
youve
just
done
all
this
'
cause
you
missed
your
-
daddydaughter

time
'
Ive
given
you
everything
you
asked
.
for
'
Ive
compromised
my
.
principles
'
Ive
risked
my
,
life
my
'
familys
.
life
All
because
you
assured
me
this
would
,
work
that
this
was
the
only
.
way
But
I
'
dont
see
any
progress
out
,
there

Martin
You

what
I
?

I
see
a

frightened
traumatized
little

its
this
very
fear

thats
now
holding
you

back
If
you

Nina

you

be
I

what
I

monster
You

Thats
the
stuff
of
myth

is
rarely
so

simple
People
are
not
so
easily
.
defined
Only
by
facing
all
of
,
ourselves
the
good
and
the
,
bad
can
we
become

all
a
little
.
confusing
-
'
Thats
when

dared
me
to
say
what
I
.
said
,

Youre

Just
the
.
facts
Are

these

Lying

a
,
crime

The
fire
is
consuming
.

Threaten

.
.
.
Okay

You
wanna
send
our
kids
to
?
jail
-
We

seriously

that
-
Shut

Oh
my
.
God
Shut

up

.
Jesus
-
.
Shh
'
Were
gonna
try
a
more
civilized
.
approach
One
at
a
.
time
You
.
first
-
,
Wait
?
what
Why
?
me
-
Follow
.
me
'
Im
not
even

Youre
losing
.
blood
Come
,
on
.
sit
All
?
right
All
.
right
…
Oh
.
Okay
So
the
good
news
is
'
Im
pretty
sure
wooziness
is
not
a
symptom
of
.
rabies
But
if
you
start
having
hallucinations
or
muscle
spasms
or
you
start
feeling
,
aggressive
like
you
wanna
punch
,
me
let
me
.
know
-
.
Robin
-
?
Yeah
I
kinda
wanna
punch
.
you
Sense
of
'
humors
still
.
intact
'
Thats
a
good
.
sign
.
Yeah
.
Okay
.
Okay
-
You
?
ready
-
.
Yeah
Just
do
.
it
.
Sorry
'
Its
.
okay
Too
?
tight
-
,
No
'
thats
.
good
-
All
.
right
.
Okay
.
Thanks
.
Yeah
,
So
,
uh
this
place
is
like
,
Hawkins
but
with
monsters
and
nasty
?
shit
Pretty
.
much
,
Wait
watch
out
for
the
.
vines
'
Its
all
a
hive
.
mind
'
Its
all
a
?
what
All
the
creepy
crawlies
around
.
here
'
,
Theyre
,
like
one
or
.
something
Step
on
a
,
vine
'
youre
stepping
on
a
,
bat
'
youre
stepping
on
.
Vecna
.
Shit
But
everything
from
our
world
is
still
,
here
?
right
Except
?
people
As
far
as
I
understand
,
it
.
yeah
,
So
,
theoretically
we
could
go
to
the
police
station
and
steal
guns
and
grenades
and
whatever
we
need
to
blow
up
those
bat
things
that
are
guarding
the
.
gate
I
highly
doubt
the
Hawkins
PD
has
,
grenades
.
Robin
But
,
guns
,
yeah
.
sure
,
Well
we
'
dont
have
to
go
all
the
way
downtown
for
.
guns
I
have
guns
in
my
.
bedroom
,
You
Nancy
,
Wheeler
have
,
guns
,
plural
in
your
?
bedroom
Full
of
,
surprises
'
isnt
?
she
A
Russian
Makarov
and
a
.
revolver
,
Yeah
you
almost
shot
me
with
that
.
one
You
almost
deserved
.
it
For
your
,
modesty
.
dude
Oh
my
!
god
So
guns
seem
like
a
pretty
good
idea
to
.
me
,
Yeah
me
.
too
So
what
are
we
waiting
?
for
You
,
know
what
we
are
to
attempt
is
quite
.
mad
Even
by
your
,
standards
.
American
?
Yeah
You
got
odds
for
us
this
?
time
I
…
think
A
thousand
to
?
one
Even
if
we
somehow
kill
this
,
beast
we
still
must
.
escape
We
fail
,
there
I
'
dont
think
they
will
be
so
kind
as
to
throw
us
back
in
a
.
cell
They
will
shoot
us
on
.
sight
'
Wed
die
as
monster
.
slayers
'
Youll
be
a
.
legend
But
still
a
.
traitor
You
forgot
.
traitor
Monster
slayer
trumps
.
traitor
I
bet
Mikhail
will
be
proud
of
his
,
pops
at
.
least
?
Mikhail
-
.
Mmm
-
.
No
I
'
cant
do
nothing
right
with
him
,
anymore
it
.
seems
He
will
,
say
"
,
Papa
I
bet
that
bald
American
did
most
of
the
monster
.
"
slaying
'
Hes
that
,
age
?
huh
,
Yeah
he
is
that
.
age
It
is
same
for
,
you
?
American
With
your
new
?
daughter
The
last
time
I
was
with
,
El
she
wanted
just
about
nothing
to
do
with
.
me
I
was
just
in
her
,
way
.
really
I
think
back
to
the
way
I
was
with
my
dad
at
that
.
age
I
was
the
same
.
way
The
exact
same
.
way
I
think
it
must
be
hardwired
into
us
to
reject
our
.
fathers
So
we
can
grow
and
move
.
on
Become
something
of
our
.
own
I
hope
'
thats
what
'
shes
.
doing
Coming
into
her
.
own
But
.
.
.
still
You
.
worry
To
worry
for
our
sons
and
,
daughters
that
is
,
natural
'
isnt
?
it
.
Yeah
But
nothing
about
what
El
has
had
to
deal
with
is
.
natural
That
,
beast
that
monster
in
,
there
'
its
a
part
of
something
that
wants
to
hurt
.
El
To
kill
.
her
I
'
dont
.
understand
To
be
,
honest
neither
do
.
I
All
I
know
is
that
…
thing
That
thing
'
shouldnt
be
.
here
It
'
shouldnt
be
.
alive
Because
it
,
is
it
means
it
still
'
isnt
.
over
I
thought
I
was
put
here
to
pay
for
what
'
Ive
.
done
But
I
'
mightve
been
put
here
for
some
other
.
reason
Maybe
…
I
Maybe
I
can
still
help
.
El
Even
if
'
its
the
last
thing
I
.
do
You
almost
sound
,
religious
.
American
?
Religious
I
'
dont
know
about
.
that
But
maybe
I
should
give
that
prayer
thing
a
.
try
'
Cause
if
we
wanna
get
out
of
,
here
get
back
to
El
and
,
Mikhail
you
and
…
me
'
Were
gonna
need
a
.
miracle
Can
I

you

for

of

may
seem

talent
that

youre
somehow
immune
to
the

rules
is
that
?
it
,
No
.
Papa
That
the
rules
'
dont
apply
to
you
in
the
same
way
that
they
apply
to
your
brothers
and

sisters
,
No
.
Papa
Then
why
did
you
attack
?
Eleven
-
Did
she
tell
you

that
-
Are
you
asking

questions

super
jealous
as

hell
by

way
Which
is
why
I
would
never
have
jumped
in

lake
to

your

ass
Not
under

any

circumstances

Nope
Outside

hero
I
see
danger

I
just
turn
heel
and

run
Or
at

'
thats
what
'
Ive
learned
about

this

week

Give
yourself

break

man

?
See
The
only
reason
I
came
in
here
was
'

those
ladies
came
in
straight
after
.
you
,
Now
I
was
too
ashamed
to
be
the
one
who
stayed
.
behind
But
Wheeler
right
,
there
she
'
didnt
waste
a
.
second
Not
one

second
She
just
dove
right
.
in
,
Now
I
'
dont
know
what
happened
between
you
,
two
but
if
I
were
,
you
I
would
get
her
.
back
'
Cause
that
was
as
unambiguous
a
sign
of
true
love
as
these
cynical
eyes
have
ever
.
seen
Goddamn
!
it
Here

The

from

And
'
weve
been
looking
for

him

'
hes
in

Upside

Down
which
we
'
cant

reach
At
least
we
thought
we
'
,
couldnt
until
we
found
a
gate
at
'
Lovers
.
Lake
That
was
the
reason
why
we
were
,
there
but
these
stupid
cops
grabbed
.
us
And
if
you
tell
anyone
about
,
this

thats

Why
would
they

What
-
The

Erica
you
have
no
idea
what

youre
talking

about
,
No
she
'
,
doesnt
yet
she
raises
an
essential
.
question
How
did
Watergate
open
?
up
Only
two
gates
have
,
opened
so
far
as
we
.
know
One
by
,
El
one
by
the
.
commies
But
'
its
not
the
commies
or
El
this
,
time
so
…
it
Holy
.
shit
,
Wait
,
wait
,
wait
.
wait
"
,
Wait
,
wait
,
"
wait
?
what
'
Theres
one
thing
'
weve
never
.
understood
Which
is
why
'
Vecnas
killing
.
people
'
Whats
his
?
motive
Killing
?
teens
It
always
just
seemed
too
.
random
Too
.
prosaic
On
top
of
,
that
how
does
the
Mind
Flayer
figure
into
all
?
this
Maybe
this
is
.
it
This
is
the
.
answer
What
is
the
?
answer
You
sure
you
just
want
?
water

We
have
,
Coke
,

Dr
.

Thank
.
you
,
Okay
just
hear
me
.
out
How
did
El
open
the
Mother
?
gate
She
contacted
 
.
theDemogorgon
With
psychic
.
contact
Just
…
like
-
Vecna
when
he
casts
his
.
spells
-
.
Exactly
,
So
what
,
if
with
each
,
kill
'
hes
not
simply
killing
,
them
'
hes
making
a
powerful
psychic
connection
with
his
?
victims
A
connection
powerful
enough
to
rip
a
hole
in
the
fabric
of
time
and
.
space
'
Hes
opening
more
.
gates
.
Bingo
.
Copy
'
Were
still
at
the
Wheeler
.
house
-
Why
would
he
be
opening
?
gates
-
To
take
over
the
.
world
Who
do
we
know
that
wants
to
take
over
the
?
world
The
Mind
.
Flayer
So
if
the
Demogorgon
was
just
his
foot
,
soldier

Vecnas
his
-
fivestar

general
A
-
fivestar
general
with
the
power
to
open

Holy

shit

That
was

incomprehensible

How

is

Lets

analyze
What
do
Eleven
and
Vecna
have
in

common
!
Dustin

Dustin
All
,
right
either

Guys
You

nonetheless

good
Does
anyone
know
Morse
?
code
.
No
,
Wait
does
SOS
?
count
Is
…
that
Is
that
?
good
So
our
working
theory
is
that
Vecna
makes
remote
contact
from
his
.
attic
We
'
dont
know
.
why
We
assume
he
can
do
it
from

understand
Two
is
still
in

recovering
'
Hes
being
watched

now

once
he
is

released
he
and
the

are
going
to
attempt

kill

you

here
in

happen

happen
'
Hes

it
for
some
time

now
Stay

calm
Focus

game
'
Theres
a
reason
why
Two
and
the
others
were
able
to
escape
their
room
last

night
Why
the
security
cameras
were
turned

off
Why
Papa
punished
Two
.
today
They
'
dont
even
realize
,
it
but
he
is
moving
them
like
pieces
on
this
board

here
Driving
them
to
do
exactly
what
he
,
wants
which
…
is
?
Why
You
frighten
.
him
He
knows
you
are
more
powerful
than
the
.
others
And
he
also
knows
he
'
cant
control
.
you
'
Thats
all
he

wants

Control
I
saw
all
this

happening

why
I
wanted
to
help

you

I
only
made
things

worse
Helping

me
Made

you

escape

us

make
it
out

alive

Why
do
you
cry
for
,
them
?
Eleven
After
everything
they
did
to
?
you
?
Hmm
You
think
you
need
,
them
but
you
'
.
dont
You
'
.
dont
,
Oh
but
I
know
'
youre
just
.
scared
I
was
scared
once
.
too
I
know
what
'
its
like
to
be
.
different
To
be
alone
in
this
.
world
I
see
'
youve
been
looking
for
,
me
.
Nancy
You
were
so
.
close
So
close
to
the
.
truth
How
was
,
old
,
blind
dumb
?
Victor
Did
he
miss
?
me
'
Ive
been
meaning
to
check
back

in
but
'
Ive
been
.
busy
So
very
.
busy
-
'
Whatd
I
tell
?
ya
-
.
Wow
This
is
.
amazing
It
looks
like
a
fairy
.
tale
A
.
dream
-
,
Alice
no
.
running
-
'
Its
so
!
big
This
is
.
nice
.
Yeah
-
.
Yeah
-
Like
,
you
I
'
didnt
fit
in
with
the
other
.
children
Something
was
wrong
with
.
me
All
the
teachers
and
the
doctors
said
I
…
was
"
,
"
Broken
they
.
said
My
parents
thought
a
change
of
,
scenery
a
fresh
start
in
,
Hawkins
might
just
cure
.
me
It
was
.
absurd
As
if
the
world
would
be
any
different
.
here
But
…
then
To
my
,
surprise
our
new
home
provided
a
.
discovery
And
a
new
found
sense
of
.
purpose
I
found
a
nest
of
black
widows
living
inside
a
.
vent
Most
people
fear
.
spiders
They
detest
.
them
And
,
yet
I
found
them
endlessly
.
fascinating
More
than
,
that
I
found
a
great
comfort
in
.
them
A
.
kinship
Like
,
me
they
are
solitary
.
creatures
And
deeply
.
misunderstood
They
are
gods
of
our
.
world
The
most
important
of
all
.
predators
They
immobilize
and
feed
on
the
,
weak
bringing
balance
and
order
to
an
unstable
.
ecosystem
But
the
human
world
was
disrupting
this
.
harmony
You
,
see
humans
are
a
unique
type
of
,
pest
multiplying
and
poisoning
our
,
world
all
while
enforcing
a
structure
of
their
.
own
A
deeply
unnatural
.
structure
Where
others
saw
,
order
I
saw
a
.
straitjacket
A
,
cruel
oppressive
world
dictated
by
-
madeup
.
rules
,
Seconds
,
minutes
,
hours
,
days
,
weeks
,
months
,
years
.
decades
Each
life
a
,
faded
lesser
copy
of
the
one
.
before
Wake
,
up
,
eat
,
work
,
sleep
,
reproduce
and
.
die
Everyone
is
just
.
waiting
Waiting
for
it
all
to
be
.
over
All
while
performing
in
a
,
silly
terrible
,
play
day
after
.
day
I
could
not
do
.
that
I
could
not
close
off
my
mind
and
join
in
the
.
madness
I
could
not
.
pretend
And
I
realized
I
'
didnt
have
.
to
I
could
make
my
own
.
rules
I
could
restore
balance
to
a
broken
.
world
A
…
predator
But
for
.
good
As
I
,
practiced
I
realized
I
could
do
more
than
I
possibly
.
imagined
I
could
reach
into
,
others
into
their
,
minds
their
.
memories
I
became
an
.
explorer
I
saw
my
parents
as
they
truly
.
were
To
the
,
world
they
presented
themselves
as
,
good
normal
.
people
But
like
everything
else
in
this
,
world
it
was
all
a
.
lie
A
terrible
.
lie
They
had
done
,
things
.
Eleven
Such
awful
.
things
I
showed
them
who
they
really
.
were
I
held
up
a
.
mirror
My
naive
father
believed
it
was
a
demon
cursing
them
for
their
.
sins
But
my
mother
somehow
.
knew
Knew
it
was
I
who
was
holding
up
that
,
mirror
and
she
despised
me
for
.
it
She
called
a
,
doctor
an
.
expert
She
wanted
him
to
lock
me
,
away
to
fix
,
me
even
though
it
'
wasnt
I
who
was
.
broken
It
was
.
them
And
so
she
left
me
with
no
.
choice
No
choice
but
to
.
act
To
break
.
free
With
each
life
I
,
took
I
grew
.
stronger
More
.
powerful
They
were
becoming
a
part
of
.
me
But
I
was
still
a
.
child
And
I
did
not
yet
know
my
.
limits
And
it
nearly
killed
.
me
He
was
,
arrested
blamed
for
the
death
of
my
sister
and
,
mother
just
as
I
had
.
planned
But
I
was
far
from
.
free
I
woke
up
from
my
coma
only
to
find
myself
placed
in
the
care
of
a
,
doctor
the
very
doctor
I
had
hoped
to
.
escape
.
Dr
Martin
.
Brenner
.
Papa
But
the
…
truth
The
truth
is
he
did
not
just
want
to
study
.
me
He
wanted
.
more
He
wanted
to
.
control
When
Papa
finally
realized
he
could
not
control
,
me
he
tried
to
recreate
.
me
He
began
a
.
program
And
,
soon
others
were
.
born
You
were
.
born
And
I
am
so
glad
you
,
were
.
Eleven
So
very
.
glad
'
Theyre
not
,
gone
.
Eleven
'
Theyre
still
with
.
me
In
.
here
You
tricked
.
me
Tricked
?
you
,
No
I
saved
.
you
You
are
a
prisoner
,
here
just
like
.
me
To
your
,
papa
you
are
nothing
more
than
an
,
animal
a
,
monster
a
lab
rat
to
be
.
tamed
But
the
,
truth
,
Eleven
the
truth
is
just
the
.
opposite
You
are
better
than
they
.
are
.
Superior
That
is
why
you
frighten
.
him
If
you
come
with
,
me
for
the
first
time
in
your
,
life
you
will
be
.
free
Imagine
what
we
could
do
.
together
We
could
reshape
the
,
world
remake
it
however
we
see
.
fit
Join
.
me
.
No
He
had
found
his
strength
in
a
memory
from
his
.
past
Something
that
made
him
.
sad
But
also
.
angry
Do
you
have
a
memory
like
?
that
!
No

Mike
I
keep
telling
myself
,
that
but
…
I
I
'
dont
believe

it
I
,
mean
'
shes
.
special
She
was
born
.
special
Maybe
I
was
one
of
the
first
people
to
realize
.
that
But
the
truth
,
is
when
I
stumbled
on
her
in
the
,
woods
she
just
needed
.
someone
'
Its
not
.
fate
'
…
Its
'
Its
not
.
destiny
'
Its
just
simple
dumb
.
luck
And
one
day
'
shes
gonna
realize
'
Im
just
some
random
nerd
that
got
lucky
that
Superman
landed
on
his
.
doorstep
I
,
mean
at
 
leastLois
Lane
is
an
ace
reporter
for
the
Daily
,
Planet
?
right
…
But
-
.
Sorry
-
.
No
,
No
…
I
'
its
so
,
stupid
given
everything
'
thats
going
.
on
'
Its
…
just
…
I
I
'
dont
,
know
I
…
just
…
Uh
'
Youre
scared
of
losing
.
her
Can
I
show
you
?
something
This
is
.
amazing
Did
you
paint
?
this
.
Yeah
.
Yeah
I
…
mean
I
…
mean
I
,
mean
El
asked
me
.
to
She
commissioned
,
it
.
basically
I
,
mean
she
told
me
what
to
.
draw
,
Anyway
my
point
,
is
see
how
'
youre
leading
us
?
here
'
Youre
guiding
the
whole
,
party
inspiring
.
us
…
That
'
Thats
what
you
.
do
And
see
your
coat
of
arms
?
here
'
Its
a
.
heart
And
I
know
'
its
sort
of
on
the
,
nose
but
'
thats
what
holds
this
party
.
together
.
Heart
,
Because
I
,
mean
without
,
heart
'
wed
all
fall
.
apart
Even
.
El
Especially
.
El
These
past
few
,
months
'
shes
been
so
lost
without
.
you
'
Its
,
just
'
shes
so
different
from
other
,
people
…
and
…
when
'
…
youre
when
'
youre
,
different
…
sometimes
…
you
feel
like
a
.
mistake
But
you
make
her
feel
like
'
shes
not
a
mistake
at
.
all
Like
'
shes
better
for
being
.
different
And
that
gives
her
the
courage
to
fight
.
on
If
she
was
mean
to
you
or
she
seemed
like
she
was
pushing
you
,
away
'
its
because
'
shes
scared
of
losing
,
you
like
'
youre
scared
of
losing
.
her
And
if
she
was
going
to
lose
,
you
…
I
I
think
'
shed
rather
just
get
it
over
with
.
quick
Like
ripping
off
 
-
.
aBandAid
,
So
,
yeah
El
needs
,
you
.
Mike
And
she
always
.
will
?
Yeah
.
Yeah
After
the
,
attack
you
fell
into
a
.
coma
Like
,
One
you
had
pushed
yourself
beyond
your
.
limit
And
it
very
nearly
destroyed
.
you
But
that
is
where
your
similarities
.
ended
What
you
displayed
that
day
was
beyond
anything
'
Id
ever
.
imagined
A
potential
'
Id
only
dreamed
.
of
But
when
you
,
awoke
something
had
been
.
lost
Your
,
memories
along
with
whatever
else
'
youd
found
within
yourself
that
.
day
But
I
knew
,
then
just
as
I
knew
,
today
that
your
powers
had
not
been
.
lost
They
just
needed
a
.
spark
But
that
,
day
you
awakened
something
.
else
A
doorway
to
another
.
world
I
always
thought
that
Henry
was
out
,
there
hiding
in
the
.
darkness
I
'
didnt
know
for
,
sure
not
beyond
a
.
feeling
Until
.
now
'
Hes
claimed
three
victims
so
,
far
and
when
I
saw
the
,
eyes
I
…
knew
I
knew
that
was
.
him
He
was
sending
us
a
,
message
letting
us
know
'
hes
.
back
'
Thats
when
I
came
to
see
.
you
My
.
friends
,
Well
…
we
we
'
havent
risked
,
contact
,
but
as
far
as
we
,
know
'
…
theyre
'
theyre
all
.
safe
But
'
Im
not
gonna
lie
to
,
you
.
Eleven
Your
friends
are
in
terrible
.
danger
With
each
victim
he
,
takes
Henry
…
is
Chiseling
away
at
the
barrier
that
exists
between
our
two
.
worlds
"
"
?
Chiseling
,
Imagine
if
you
,
will
the
barrier
between
our
worlds
is
…
a
Concrete
.
dam
Henry
is
putting
cracks
in
this
.
dam
Cracks
in
dams
create
.
pressure
Left
,
unchecked
the
pressure
will
.
build
And
.
build
And
,
eventually
it
will
reach
a
breaking
.
point
And
the
dam
will
.
burst
And
when
that
,
happens
Hawkins
will
.
fall
,
Well
that
went
very
,
well
I
.
thought
You
eased
her
into
,
it
nice
and
,
gentle
just
like
we
talked
.
about
Not
ominous
at
.
all
He
showed
me
things
that
'
havent
happened
.
yet
The
most
awful
.
things
I
saw
a
dark
cloud
spreading
over
.
Hawkins
Downtown
on
.
fire
Dead
.
soldiers
And
…
this
Giant
creature
…
with
a
gaping
.
mouth
And
this
creature
'
wasnt
.
alone
There
were
so
many
.
monsters
An
.
army
And
they
were
coming
into
.
Hawkins
Into
our
.
neighborhoods
Our
.
homes
And
…
then
He
showed
me
my
.
mom
And
.
Holly
.
Mike
And
…
they
They
were
…
all
,
Okay
…
but
'
hes
just
trying
to
scare
,
you
.
Nance
?
Right
I
…
mean
I
,
mean
'
its
not
.
real
Not
.
yet
But
…
there
there
was
something
.
else
He
showed
me
.
gates
Four
.
gates
Spreading
across
.
Hawkins
And
these
,
gates
they
looked
like
the
one
outside
of
'
Eddies
,
trailer
…
but
they
'
didnt
stop
.
growing
And
this
'
wasnt
the
Upside
Down
.
Hawkins
This
was
our
.
Hawkins
Our
.
home
Four

clock
It

Hes
been
telling
us
his
plan
this
whole
.
time
Four

Four

coincidence
It
'
cant

be

Whatevers
happening
in
Lenora
is
connected
to
all
of
.
this
'
Im
sure
of
.
it
But
Vecna
'
cant
hurt
.
them
Not
if
'
hes

dead
We
have
to
go
back
in

there
Back
to
the
Upside
.
Down
-
,
Whoa
,
no
,
no
.
no
?
What
-
.
Nope
-
'
Lets
think
this
.
through
-
What
is
there
to
think
?
through
-
We
barely
made
it
out
of
.
there
-
,
Yeah
because
we
'
werent
.
prepared
But
this
,
time
we
will
.
be
'
Well
get
weapons
and
.
protection
'
Well
go
through
the
,
gate
'
well
find
his
,
lair
and
'
well
kill
.
him
Or
'
hell
kill
.
us
The
only
reason
you
survived
is
because
he
wanted
you
.
to
-
'
Hes
not
scared
of
.
us
-
And
for
good
.
reason
We
were
wrong
about
.
Vecna
.
 
.
HenryOne
,
Sorry
what
are
we
calling
him
?
now
-
.
One
-
.
Vecna
-
.
Henry
-
.
Right
'
Weve
learned
something
new
about
/
/
.
VecnaHenryOne
'
Hes
a
number
like
,
Eleven
only
a
,
sick
,
evil
,
male
-
childmurdering
version
of
her
with
really
bad
.
skin
But
…
my
my
point
,
is
'
hes
super
.
powerful
Could
turn
us
inside
out
with
a
snap
of
his
.
fingers
'
Its
not
a
fair
.
fight
Then
why
fight
?
fair
'
Youre
.
right
'
Hes
like
.
Eleven
But
that
gives
us
an
upper
.
hand
We
know
'
Elevens
.
strengths
And
.
weaknesses
?
Weaknesses
When
El
-
,
remotetravels
she
goes
into
this
sort
 
-
oftrancelike
.
state
I
bet
the
same
is
true
of
.
Vecna
That
would
explain
what
he
was
doing
in
that
.
attic
.
Exactly
When
he
attacks
his
next
,
victim
'
Ill
bet
you
'
hes
back
in
that
,
attic
physical
body
.
defenseless
?
Defenseless
What
about
the
army
of
?
bats
.
True
'
Well
have
to
find
a
way
past
.
them
Distract
them
.
somehow
-
,
And
,
uh
how
do
we
do
,
that
?
exactly
-
No
.
idea
But
once
'
theyre
,
gone
he
'
doesnt
stand
a
.
chance
'
Itll
be
like
slaying
sleeping
Dracula
in
his
.
coffin
That
all
sounds
good
in
,
theory
but
there
is
no
pattern
to
'
Vecnas
.
killings
Not
one
that
I
can
.
decipher
We
'
dont
know
when
'
hes
going
to
attack
.
next
-
'
Dont
even
know
who
'
hes
going
to
.
attack
-
,
Yeah
we
.
do
I
can
still
feel

him
'
Im
still

marked
.
Cursed
I
ditch
Kate
,
Bush
I
draw
his
focus
back
to
.
me

Max
You
'
.
cant
'
Hell
kill
.
you
I
survived
.
before
I
can
survive
.
again
I
just
need
to
keep
him
busy
long
enough
so
that
you
guys
can
get
into
that
.
attic
Then
you
can
chop
his
head
.
off
Stab
him
in
the
.
heart
Blow
him
up
with
some
explosive
Dustin
cooks
.
up
I
honestly
'

how
you

be

If

me
Your

are
not
prepared
for
this
,
fight
.
Eleven
And
neither
are
.
you
You
must
,
understand
when
One
,
kills
he
'
doesnt
simply
.
kill
He
.
consumes
He
takes
everything
from
his
.
victims
Everything
they
are
and
everything
they
ever
will
.
be
Their
,
memories
their
.
abilities
And
we
do
not
know
where
'
hes
been
these
lost
.
years
But
if
he
has
survived
this
,
long
we
can
only
assume
that
he
has
grown
in
.
strength
To
underestimate
,
him
to
act
,
rashly
would
be
very
.
dangerous
I
'
dont
want
to
upset
,
you
.
Eleven
What
'
youve
accomplished
is
nothing
short
of
a
.
miracle
You
came
to
me
.
broken
And
'
youve
learned
to
walk
.
again
But
if
you
want
to
stop
,
One
you
will
need
to
do
more
than
.
walk
You
will
need
to
do
more
than
.
run
You
will
need
to
.
fly
And
'
youre
not
.
ready
My
friends
need
.
me
'
Ive
stopped
him
.
once
I
will
.
again
'
Im
.
sorry
You
'
.
cant
'
Its

impossible
'
Nothings
.
impossible
I
can
call

Stinson
'
Shes
got
connections
at
.
Nellis
'
Thats
two
hours
.
away
And
if
we
,
hustle
'
Ill
bet
we
can
be
in
Hawkins
before
.
nightfall
That
would
be
a
grave
.
mistake
Waiting
would
be
an
even
greater
.
mistake
What
if
One
makes
his
move
before
'
weve
had
a
chance
to
throw
a
?
punch
Then
what
is
the
point
of
all
?
this
'
Thats
a
risk
'
were
going
to
have
to
.
take
We
pushed
her
before
and
look
what
.
happened
She
lifted

pound
tank
into
the
goddamn
.
air
You
'
dont
understand
what
'
hes
capable
!
of
Maybe
'
youre
.
right
Or
maybe
you
are
overestimating
.
him
Either
,
way
'
doesnt
matter
because
this
is
not
our
.
choice
We
agreed
this
was
not
gonna
be
a
.
prison
'
Well
show
her
what
this
,
is
what
we
can
,
offer
and
then
it
is
her
choice
whether
she
wants
to
stay
or
.
go
,
Right
?
Doc
You
may
not
agree
with
,
it
but
here
she
,
is
standing
before
,
us
making
a
.
choice
'
Youre
sure
you
wanna
do
?
this
.
Okay
Pack
your
,
things
say
your
.
goodbyes
-
'
Hows
it
?
handle
-
Not
half
.
bad
Considering
that
this
is
…
a
.
House
,
Yeah
'
…
its
'
Its
,
silly
but
…
I
'
Ive
…
actually
I
always
had
this
dream
that
'
Id
have
this
…
really
really
big
.
family
'
Im
,
talking
,
like
,
uh
a
full
brood
of
.
Harringtons
,
Like
,
five
six
.
kids
-
?
Six
-
.
Yeah
Six
little
.
nuggets
Three
,
girls
three
.
boys
…
And
and
every
,
summer
I
figured
all
of
us
,
Harringtons
we
would
pack
into
something
like
this
…
and
just
see
the
.
country
You
,
know
the
,
Rockies
Grand
,
Canyon
maybe
.
Yellowstone
End
up
in
some
beach
side
town
in
.
California
Spend
a
week
parked
in
the
.
sand
Learn
how
to
surf
or
.
something
That
sounds
.
nice
?
Yeah
.
Yeah
,
Well
,
uh
except
for
the
-
sixkid
.
part
That
sounds
like
a
total
.
nightmare
If
only
I
had
some
.
practice
All
.
right
.
Fair
'
Thats
.
fair
.
Hey
So
'
Ive
been
,
thinking
two
of
the
three
of
'
Vecnas
victims
were
seeing
.
Ms
,
Kelley
?
right
-
.
Yeah
-
.
Okay
So
I
figure
'
theres
a
good
chance
Vecna
cursed
another
one
of
her
.
students
We
go
back
to
her
.
office
We
read
all
of
her
.
files
Look
for
mentions
of
,
headaches
,
nosebleeds
.
nightmares
-
We
identify
his
most
likely
next
.
victim
-
.
Lucas
-
We
stake
out
his
.
.
.
house
-
,
Lucas
.
stop
We
'
dont
have
time
for
any
of
,
that
?
okay
And
even
if
we
,
did
even
if
your
plan
did
,
work
'
wed
be
putting
a
total
stranger
at
.
risk
A
stranger
who
has
no
idea
what
'
theyre
up
.
against
I
.
do
He
uses
my
memories
against
.
me
…
But
only
my
darkest
.
memories
-
Same
with
Chrissy
and
,
Fred
?
right
-
.
Right
'
Its
like
he
only
sees
the
darkness
in
.
us
,
So
'
Ill
just
run
in
the
opposite
.
direction
Run
to
the
.
light
And
maybe
he
'
wont
be
able
to
find
me
.
there
,
Now
how
exactly
do
you
plan
on
doing
?
this
'
Im
not
.
sure
But
'
its
my
.
mind
Not
,
his
?
right
So
I
should
be
able
to
control
where
I
.
am
I
just
need
…
to
push
him
.
away
Find
a
happy
memory
and
hide
.
there
Hide
in
the
.
light
You
got
a
memory
in
?
mind
.
Yeah
It
was
a
time
when
I
was
the
.
happiest
Was
I
?
there
'
Thats
presumptuous
of
.
you
But
.
yeah
You
'
mightve
been
.
there
,
Okay

second

your
military
friends
do
not
shoot
us
out
of

we
can
make
it

coast

There
while
we
,
refuel
we
skin
dip
in
-
icecold
water
and
wash
off
this

muck
Then
we
fly

rest
of
the

Ryan
on
this
.
one
You
know
the
murder
house
on
More
?
head
.
Yeah
What
about
?
it
,
Okay
,
and
,
uh
who
exactly
was
this
mystery
?
woman
Not
.
sure
I
,
mean
she
'
wasnt
exactly
Miss
.
Talkative
You
?
know
I
spent
five
minutes
trying
to
convince
her
I
was
.
real
'
Im
supposed
to
be
,
dead
?
remember
,
Anyway
I
finally
get
around
to
-
halfconvincing
,
her
she
starts
to
open
up
a
,
little
then
says
that
'
…
shes
A
friend
of
the
'
.
docs
,
Great
so
am
.
I
Now
put
me
on
the
phone
with
.
him
'
Im
afraid
the
doc
is
.
indisposed
"
"
?
Indisposed
It
gets
.
worse
She
said
the
'
docs
with
the
.
girl
And
the
girl
went
off
to
fight
some
evil
in
.
Hawkins
Then
they
all
went
-
.
offgrid
The
,
doc
the
,
girl
.
everybody
"
The
,
"
girl
…
meaning
.
El
,
Yeah
it
has
to
.
be
This
is
your
,
daughter
?
American
-
.
Mmhmm
And
'
theyre
not
.
alone
'
Joyces
kids
are
with
'
.
em
,
Okay
…
I
I
see
the
mood
here
is
.
bleak
And
understandably
.
so
But
I
do
think
we
need
to
consider
the
very
real
possibility
that
this
mystery
woman
,
is
in
,
fact
.
KGB
-
And
'
.
.
.
shes
-
.
No
'
Shes
telling
the
.
truth
When
we
were
in
the
,
lab
those
particles
we
,
saw
they
were
.
alive
And
if
'
theyre
,
alive
that
means
a
'
gates
open
in
.
Hawkins
"
"
?
Gate
What
does
this
?
mean
It
means
we
have
to
go
home
right
.
now
What
is
taking
so
?
long
I
thought
you
said
he
was
.
close
,
Yeah
close
to
sabotaging
,
us
you
.
mean
We
think
'
hes
playing
us
.
again
So
put
a
goddamn
gun
to
his
.
head
And
then
?
what
He
just
spits
out
more
.
lies
'
Its
moot
.
anyway
If
your
kids
are
truly
in
some
kind
of
imminent
,
danger
even
if
we
were
to
leave
this
very
,
moment
we
'
wouldnt
make
it
in
.
time
The
earliest
'
wed
get
there
is
late
.
tomorrow
,
No
…
we
we
'
dont
have
to
make
it
.
back
Not
.
tonight
Whatever
this
evil
,
is
we
know
'
its
connected
to
the
hive
.
mind
And
now
we
know
part
of
that
hive
mind
is
in
.
Russia
So
we
'
dont
need
to
get
back
to
Hawkins
to
fight
.
it
All
we
need
is
to
destroy
those
.
particles
And
if
'
were
,
lucky
'
itll
hurt
it
enough
to
give
the
kids
the
upper
.
hand
,
Wait
time
.
out
'
Were
talking
about
the
particles
inside
the
?
prison
The
prison
that
we
just
narrowly
escaped
?
from
We
broke
.
out
We
can
break
back
.
in
!
Jim
The
entire
Soviet
army
is
looking
for
.
us
.
Sure
And
'
well
be
exactly
where
they
least
.
expect
All
.
right
There
is
a
fine
line
between
courage
and
,
stupidity
and
this
falls
very
far
on
the
side
of
.
stupid
This
is
Dirty
Dozen
.
stuff
Except
there
,
are
,
uh
four
of
.
us
,
Three
.
actually
Breaking
back
'
ins
gonna
be
easier
than
breaking

Which
is
why
we
need
an
.
airlift

is
where

.
in

'
Shes

super
?
klutz
She
did
tell
me
that
it
took
her
longer
to
walk
than
most
,
babies
…
so
I
really
'
shouldnt
.
laugh
When
I
was
a
,
baby
I
actually
crawled
.
backwards
Crawled
?
backwards
You
,

this
.
Beep

sense
You
push
to
,
move
?
right
,
No
,
no
it
'
doesnt
make
.
sense
,
Well
it
did
to
my
tiny
little
Harrington
.
brain
That
,
is
until
I
reversed
my
baby
butt
down
a
flight
of
stairs
and
thumped
my
head
really
.
good
.
Yeah
.
Wow
That
explains
so
.
much
.
Yeah
I
think
it
kinda
.
does
I
,
think
,
like
right
out
of
the
,
gate
,
like
'
Im
super
.
confident
But
'
Im
,
also
,
like
an
.
idiot
Which
is
…
just
I
,
mean
'
its
a
brutal
.
combination
,
But
I
,
mean
the
good
news
,
is
I
get
a
big
enough
thump
on
my
,
head
I
can
,
change
you
?
know
I
can
.
learn
I
can
crawl
.
forward
,
Listen
I
guess
what
'
Im
trying
to
say
in
a
really
,
stupid
roundabout
way
,
is
…
um
…
is
thank
.
you
Thank

me

needed

it
'
Its
changed
my
.
life
And
now
'
Im
crawling

just
wonder
…
sometimes
You

know
…
if
some
other
girl
had
given
me
a
proper
thump
before
'
wed
,
met

things
have
been
?
different
,
Like
if
we
were
meeting
together
for
the
first
time
right
,
now
part
of
…
me
I
,
dunno
part
of
me
thinks
we

wouldve
made
.
it
…

They

warned
us
of
a
great
evil
in
the

world
An
evil
that
does
not

rest
that
does
not
respect

borders
After
it

consumed
everything
in
their
,
land
it
will
come
for
.
us
For
our
.
families
For
our
.
Motherland
You

it
with
your
own
.
eyes
You

it
to
be
.
true
And

you
continue
to
play
!
tricks
I
was
told
the
Peanut
Butter
Smuggler
was
once
a
great
.
man
Before
he
lost
his
way
to
drink
and
.
cards
That
he
led
his
men
to
victory
over
the
Chinese
in
.
Damansky
Is

getting
just
.
complicated
A
lot
more

…

'
dont
want
you
to
forget
that
'

I

you
can

.
me
I
know
you
can
read
my
.
thoughts
Even
the
worst
.
ones
Maybe
mostly
the
worst
.
ones
I
thought
about
what
you
.
said
About
how
I
wanted
my
brother
to
.
die
I
thought
you
were
just
trying
to
upset
.
me
To
anger
.
me
But
you
'
,
werent
were
?
you
You
were
just
telling
the
.
truth
,
Billy
he
made
my
life
living
.
hell
Every
chance
he
.
got
,
So
…
sometimes
When
I
would
lie
in
bed
at
,
night
I
…
would
I
would
…
pray
…
I
would
pray
that
something
would
happen
to
.
him
Something
.
awful
I
knew
that
he
drove
too
,
fast
so
I
would
imagine
him
.
crashing
Dying
in
that
stupid
.
car
I
…
just
I
wanted
him
out
of
my
.
life
.
Forever
I
wanted
him
to
.
disappear
The
day
that
he
…
died
I
think
'
thats
why
I
just
stood
.
there
.
Watched
Not
because
I
was
scared
…
or
.
weak
But
…
because
I
'
didnt
know
if
he
deserved
to
be
.
saved
And
'
Ive
tried
to
forgive
.
myself
'
Ive
,
tried
…
but
I
'
.
cant
I
'
.
cant
So
…
now
,
Now
when
I
lie
in
bed
at
…
night
I
pray
that
something
will
happen
to
.
me
That
something
terrible
will
happen
to
.
me
So
'
thats
why
'
Im
.
here
…
Because
I
just
want
you
to
take
me
.
away
And
I
want
…
you
To
make
me
.
disappear
Is
that
all
?
true
You
wanted
Billy
to
.
die
Why

You
and
,
I
we

different
And
Papa
did
hurt
.
me
But
he
was
no
.
monster
He
was
just
a
.
man
An
,
ordinary
mediocre
.
man
That
is
why
he
sought
greatness
in
.
others
In
.
you
And
.
me
.
Hmm
But
in
the
…
end
He
could
not

us

you

He
did

make
me
into

this
You

did
At
,
first
I
believed
you
had
sent
me
to
my
.
death
To

purgatory
But
I
was
.
wrong
I
was
somewhere
.
new
I
became
an
.
explorer
An
explorer
of
a
realm
unspoiled
by
.
mankind
I
saw
so
many
.
things
And
one
,
day
I
found
the
most
extraordinary
thing
of
.
all
Something
that
would
change
.
everything
I
saw
a
means
to
realize
my
.
potential
To
transcend
my
human
.
form
To
become
the
predator
I
was
always
born
to
.
be
It
…
was
It
was
.
you
Always
.
you
All
I
needed
was
someone
to
open
the
.
door
And
you
did
that
for
.
me
Without
even
realizing
.
it
'
Didnt
?
you
And
when
you
did
,
realize
you
chose
to
.
resist
So
I
sought
a
means
to
open
my
own
.
doors
I
…
sought
Your
.
power
All
this
,
time
'
weve
been
building
.
it
For
.
you
,
So
'
dont
you
?

Once
,
again
you
have
freed
.
me
