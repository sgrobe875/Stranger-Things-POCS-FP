That

Will
Mike
Lucas
you

Even

then
I

Are
you
sure
youre

I
dont

I

somehow
shes

him
Like
like
Professor
X
Yeah
Are
you
actually
believing
this
crap
I
dont
know
I
mean
Do
you
remember
when
Will
fell
off
his
bike
and
broke
his
finger
He
sounded
a
lot
like
that
Did
you
guys
not
see
what
I
saw
They
pulled
Wills
body
out
of
the
water
Hes
dead
Well
maybe
its
his
ghost
Maybe
hes
haunting
us
Its
not
his
ghost
So
how
do
you
know
that
I
just
do
Then
what
was
in
that
water
I
dont
know
All
I
know
is
Will

Will

Nancy
Wheeler
If
youll
come

please
POWELL
This
argument
you
and
Barbara
had
What
exactly
was
it
about
NANCY
It
wasnt
really
an
argument
Barb
just
wanted
to
leave
I
didnt
so
I
I
told
her
to
just
go
home
Then
what
Then
I
went
upstairs
to
put
on
some
dry
clothes
And
the
next
day
you
went
back
and
saw
a
bear
youre
thinking
I
dont
know
what
it
was
but
I
think
I
think
maybe
it
took
Barb
You
need
to
check
behind
Steves
house
We
did
Theres
nothing
there
Theres
no
sign
of
a
bear
And
no

What
Callahan
Look
We
figure
that
Barbara
came
back
last
night
and
then
she
took
off
went
somewhere
else
Has
she
ever
talked
to
you
about
running
off
Leaving
town
maybe
No
No
Barb
wouldnt
do
that
ever
She
wasnt
maybe
upset
about
the
fact
that
you
were
spending
time
with
this
boy
Uh
Steve
Harrington
What
No
Maybe
she
was
jealous
because
she
saw
you
go
up
to
Steves
room
It
wasnt
like
that
Like
what
Steve
and
me
were
were
just
friends
We
we
just
talked
Now
was
this
before

after

Lets
take

says
hes
never

like
it
Mr

Yeah
he

Mr

Oh
hey
there
How
are
you
boys
holding
up
MUNCHING
Were
in
mourning
Man
these
arent
real
Nilla
Wafers
MIKE
We
were
wondering
if
you
had
time
to
talk
We
have
some
questions
A
lot
of
questions
So
you
know
how
in
Cosmos
Carl
Sagan
talks
about
other
dimensions
Like
beyond
our
world
Yeah
sure
Theoretically
Right
theoretically
So
theoretically
how
do
we
travel
there
You
guys
have
been
thinking
about
Hugh
Everetts
ManyWorlds
Interpretation
havent
you
Well
basically
there
are
parallel
universes
Just
like
our
world
but
just
infinite
variations
of
it
Which
means
theres
a
world
out
there
where
none
of
this
tragic
stuff
ever
happened
Yeah
thats
not
what
were
talking
about
Oh
We
were
thinking
of
more
of
an
evil
dimension
like
the
Vale
of
Shadows
You
know
the
Vale
of
Shadows
An
echo
of
the
Material
Plane
where
necrotic
and
shadow
magic
MIKE
Yeah
exactly
If
that
did
exist
a
place
like
the
Vale
of
Shadows
how
would
we
travel
there
Theoretically
MR
CLARK
Well
Picture
an
acrobat
standing
on
a
tightrope
Now
the
tightrope
is
our
dimension
And
our
dimension
has
rules
You
can
move
forwards
or
backwards
But
what
if
right
next
to
our
acrobat
there
is
a
flea
Now
the
flea
can
also
travel
back
and
forth
just
like
the
acrobat
Right
Right
Heres
where
things
get
really
interesting
The
flea
can
also
travel
this
way
along
the
side
of
the
rope
He
can
even
go
underneath
the
rope
BOYS
Upside
down
Exactly
But
were
not
the
flea
were
the
acrobat
In
this
metaphor
yes
were
the
acrobat
So
we
cant
go
upside
down
No
Well
is
there
any
way
for
the
acrobat
to
get
to
the
Upside
Down
Well
youd
have
to
create
a
massive
amount
of
energy
More
than
humans
are
currently
capable
of
creating
mind
you
to
open
up
some
kind
of
tear
in
time
and
space
and
then
you
create
a
doorway
Like
a
gate
Sure
Like
a
gate
But
again
this
is
all
Theoretical
But
but
what
if
this
gate
already
existed
Well
if
it
did
I
I
think
wed
know
It
would
disrupt
gravity
the
magnetic
field
our
environment
Heck
it
might
even
swallow
us
up
whole
Science
is
neat
But
Im
afraid
its
not
very
forgiving
Whoa
Hey
Chief

Hey

all

they
didnt

She
thought
they
were
on

but
shes
not

I
think
this
whole
Will
Byers
thing
has
everybody
on

Where
was
this
It
was
at
the
station
No
no
Where
did
Henry
and
Dale
go
hunting
Oh
Uh
out
near
Kerley
Mirkwood
What
Okay
You
go
back

Ill
take
care
of
this
all
right
Are
you
sure
Yeah
leave
it
Oh
hey
Uh
they
found
Barbaras

What
Barbara
Hollands

Seems
she
ran

Staties
found

HAMMERING
CONTINUES
I
told
you
not
to
take
these
down
They
were
in
the
way
babe
How
long
are
you
gonna
keep
those
up
I
mean
really
You
know
its
a
shame
what
theyve
done
to
this
family
What
The
Sattler
Company
I
went
to
the
quarry
on
the
way
over
here
I
just
wanted
to
look
around
you
know
Couldnt
believe
it
I
just
couldnt
believe
it
No
warning
signs
no
fence
no
nothing
Ought
to
be
held
accountable
if
you
ask
me
It
would
take
a
lot
of
energy
to
build
a
gate
like
this
But
thats
got
to
be
what
happened
Otherwise
howd
Will
get
there
right
Right
What
we
want
to
know
is
do
you
know
where
the
gate
is
Then
how
do
you
know
about
the
Upside
Down
MIKE
Dustin
what
are
you
doing
Dustin
Dustin
Dustin
I
I
need
to
see
your
compasses
What
Your
compasses
All
of
your
compasses
right
now
Whats
exciting
about
this
Well
theyre
all
facing
north
right
Yeah
so
Well
thats
not
true
north
What
do
you
mean
I
mean
exactly
what
I
just
said
Thats
not
true
north
Are
you
both
seriously
this
dense
The
sun
rises
in
the
east
and
it
sets
in
the
west
Right
Which
means
thats
true
north
So
what
youre
saying
is
the
compasses
are
broken
SIGHS
Do
you
even
understand
how
a
compass
works
Do
you
see
a
battery
pack
in
this
No
No
you
dont
Because
it
doesnt
need
one
The
needles
naturally
drawn
to
the
Earths
magnetic
North
Pole
So
whats
wrong
with
them
Well
thats
what
I
couldnt
figure
out
but
then
I
remembered
You
can
change
the
direction
of
a
compass
with
a
magnet
If
theres
the
presence
of
a
more
powerful
magnetic
field
the
needle
deflects
to
that
power
And
then
I
remembered
what
Mr
Clarke
said
The
gate
would
have
so
much

A

My

My

older
but
he
had
a
cushy
job
money
came

Uh
I
think
a
portal
to
another
dimension
is
gonna
be
pretty
obvious
SIGHS
Do
you
think
shes
acting
weird
Youre
asking
if
the
weirdo

I

SIGHS
NANCY
You
never
said
what
I
was
saying
JONATHON
What
NANCY
Yesterday
You
thought
I
was
saying
something
and
thats
why
you
took
my
picture
Oh
uh
I
dont
know
My
guess
I
saw
this
girl
you
know
trying
to
be
someone
else
But
for
that
moment
it
was
like
you
were
alone
or
you
thought
you
were
And
you
know
you
could
just
be
yourself
That
is
such
bullshit
STAMMERS
What
I
am
not
trying
to
be
someone
else
Just
because
Im
dating
Steve
and
you
dont
like
him
You
know
what
Forget
it
I
just
thought
it
was
a
good
picture
Hes
actually
a
good
guy
STAMMERS
Okay
Yesterday
with
the
camera
Hes
not
like
that
at
all
He
was
just
being
protective
Yeah
thats
one
word
for
it
Oh
and
I
guess
what
you
did
was
okay
No
I
I
never
said
that
He
had
every
right
to
be
pissed
Okay
all
right
Does
that
mean
I
have
to
like
him
No
Listen
dont
take
it
so
personally
okay
I
dont
like
most
people
Hes
in
the
vast
majority
You
know
I
was
actually
starting
to
think
that
you
were
okay
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I
was
thinking
Jonathan
Byers
maybe
hes
not
the
pretentious
creep
everyone
says
he
is
Well
I
was
just
starting
to
think
you
were
okay
Oh
I
was
thinking
Nancy
Wheeler
shes
not
just
another
suburban
girl
who
thinks
shes
rebelling
by
doing
exactly
what
every
other
suburban
girl
does
until
that
phase
passes
and
they
marry
some
boring
onetime
jock
who
now
works
sales
and
they
live
out
a
perfectly
boring
little
life
at
the
end
of
a
culdesac
Exactly
like
their
parents
who
they
thought
were
so
depressing
but
now
hey
they

it

think
that
it
lives
there
It
was
feeding
there
Feeding
on
that
deer
That
means
that
if
INHALES
DEEPLY
if
Will
and
Barbara
Hey
My
mom
said
she
talked
to
Will
If
hes
alive
theres
a
chance
Barbara
is
too
That
means
that
shes
trapped
in
that
place
We
have
to
find
it
again
You
wanna
go
back
out
there
Maybe
we
dont
have
to
When
I
saw
it
it
was
feeding
on
that
deer
Meaning
its
its
a
predator
right
Right
And
it
seems
to
hunt
at
night
like
a
a
lion
or
a
coyote
But
it
doesnt
hunt
in
packs
like
them
Its
always
alone
like
like
a
bear
And
remember
at
Steves
when
Barb
cut
herself
And
then
last
night
the
deer
Hmm
it
was
bleeding
too
One
sec
Sharks
can
detect
blood
in
one
part
per
million
Thats
one
drop
of
blood
in
a
million
and
they
can
smell
it
from
a
quarter
mile
away
So
youre
saying
it
can
detect
blood
SOFTLY
Its
just
a
theory
We
could
test
it
But
if
it
works
At
least
well
know
its
coming

She
didnt

Mike

Hello
My

Joyce
Byers
Uh
this
is
Hopper
We
drove
over
from

Um
you
see
uh
my
son
hes
been
missing
for
almost
a
week
now
and
um
we
were
wondering
if
we
could
talk
to
you
about
your
daughter
Jane
If
theres
anything
that
you
could
tell
us
about
when
she
was
taken
What
was
your
relationship
with
Dr

You
guys
keep

This
is
uh
this
is
him

DUSTIN
This

I
get
it
I
didnt
get
here
until
the
fourth
grade
He
had
the
advantage
of
living
next
door
But
none
of
that
matters
What
matters
is
that
he
is
your
best
friend
And
then
this
girl
shows
up
and
starts
living
in
your
basement
and
all
you
ever
want
to
do
is
pay
attention
to
her
Thats
not
true
Yes
it
is
And
you
know
it
And
he
knows
it
But
no
one
ever
says
anything
until
you
both
start
punching
and
yelling
at
each
other
like
goblins
with
intelligence
scores
of
zero
Now
everythings
weird
Hes
not
my

Multiple

I
heard
that
story
Did
you
hear
the
one
about
the
fat
man
with
the
beard
who
climbs
down
chimneys
Then
last
month
a
coworker
of
Ted
Wheelers
claims
some
Russian
girl
with
a
shaved
head
was
hiding
in
his
basement
Ted
now
denies
this
Oh
wow
Thats
a
surprise
But
it
connects
Enlighten
me
This
girl
shes
some
kind
of
a
Russian
weapon
right
Barbara
sees
this
girl
tries
to
help
her
perhaps
But
before
she
can
the
Russians
find
them
take
them
Wait
Youre
telling
me
Barbara
Holland
was
kidnapped
by
Russian
spies
Kidnapped
Killed
Killed
Dont

get
it
Jim
No
This
has
potentially
international
implications
Im
talking
a
fullon
Russian
invasion
right
here
in
Hawkins
Do
you
have
any
proof
of
this
girl
I

Excuse

first
paragraph
you
used
the
basketball
game
versus
Northern
as
a

Lets

I

since
we

you
last
Must

making
room
for
all
that
Halloween
candy
Whats
your
favorite
candy
Desert
island
candy
if
you

Life
or
death
situation

I
guess
Reeses
Pieces
Reeses
Pieces
Good
call
Good
call
Im
more
of
a
Mounds
guy
but
I
gotta
say
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
come
on
hard
to
beat
that
All
right
tell
me
whats
going
on
with
you
Tell
me
about
this
episode
you
had
Well
my
friends
were
there
and
then
they
just
werent
and
I
was
back
there
again
In
the
Upside
Down
All
right
so
what
happened
next
I
heard
this
noise
and
so
I
went
outside
and
it
was
worse
How
was
it
worse
There
was
this
storm
Okay
So
how
did
you
feel
when
you
saw
the
storm
I
felt
frozen
Heart
racing
Just
frozen
Frozen
cold
frozen
Frozen
to
the
touch
No
Like
how
you
feel
when
youre
scared
and
you
cant
breathe
or
talk
or
do
anything
I
felt
felt
this
evil
like
it
was
looking
at
me
It
was
evil
Well
What
do
you
think
the
evil
wanted
To
kill
To
kill
you
Not
me
Everyone
else
All
right
Im
gonna
be
honest
with
you
Its
probably
gonna
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
Worse
Hes
already
had
two
episodes
this
month
Hell
likely
have
more
before
the
month
is
out
Its
called
the
Anniversary
Effect
And
weve
seen
this
with
soldiers
The
anniversary
of
an
event
brings
back
traumatic
memories
Sort
of
opens
up
the
neurological
floodgates
so
to
speak
So
what
does
this
mean
for
the
kid
Hes
gonna
have
more
episodes
nightmares
Yeah
that
Maybe
some
personality
changes
He
might
get
irritable
He
might
lash
out
What
do
we
do
when
that
happens
Okay
Well
from
what
we
know
about
posttraumatic
stress
And
were
still
learning
okay
Just
treat
him
normally
Be
patient
with
him
Dont
pressure
him
to
talk
Just
let
him
lead
the
way
Im
sorry
what
youre
saying
is
its
gonna
get
worse
and
worse
and
were
just
supposed
to
pretend
its
not
happening
It
sounds
counterintuitive
I
know
But
I
assure
you
that
is
really
the
best
thing
you
can
do
for
him
Listen
I
understand
what
you
went
through
last
year
I
get
it
But
those
people
are
gone
Theyre
gone
Okay
So
if
were
gonna
get
through
this
I
just
I
need
you
to
realize
Im
on
your
side
I
need
you
to
trust
me
Trust
me
Are
you
kidding
me
Yeah
I
know
But
you
know

out
a
degree

posttraumatic

SIGHS
It

fell
asleep

always
Mr
Baldo
came
to
me
Only
this
time
I
didnt

This
time
I
stood
my
ground
I
just

at
Mr
Baldo
in
his
stupid
face
and
I
said
Go

Go

it
He
got
lost
in
the
woods
for
a

why
is
he
a
zombie
Because
everyone
thought
he
was
dead

a
funeral
for
him
and
everything
After
a
week
Well

was
Will

his
body
was
super
decomposed
What
Okay

not
funny
Its
not
a
joke
all
right
Its
public
knowledge
You

really
sensitive
about
it
All

one
of

great
medical
curiosities

Phineas
was
a
railroad
worker
in
who
had
a
nightmarish
accident
A
large
iron
rod
was
driven
completely
through
his
head
Phineas
miraculously
survived
He
seemed
fine
And
physically
yes
he
was
But
his
injury
resulted
in
a
complete
change
to
his
personality
So
much
so
that
friends
that
knew
him
started
referring
to
him
as
No
longer
Gage
At
the
time
this
was
known
as
the
American
Crowbar

SCOFFS
Jesus

cant
handle
your
alcohol
Uh
You
remember
going
to
Tinas
party
last
night
right
Yes
And
then
what
I
remember
dancing
and
spilling
some
punch
You
got
mad
at
me
because
I
was
drunk
and
then
you
took
me
home
SCOFFS
No

where
your
mind
gets
a
little
bit
fuzzy
That
was
your
other
boyfriend
That
was
That
was
Jonathan
I
dont
understand
Its
pretty
simple
Nancy
You
were
just
telling
it
like
it
is
What
Uh
apparently
uh
we
killed
Barb
and
I
dont
care
cause
Im
bullshit
and
our
whole
our
whole
relationship
is
bullshit
and
I
mean
pretty
much
everything
is
just
bullshit
bullshit
bullshit
Oh
yeah
also
you
dont
love
me
I
was
drunk
Steve
I
dont
remember
any
of
that
So
that
makes
everything
that
you
said
Its
what
Just
bullshit
too
Yes
Well
then
tell
me
Tell

what
You
love

Really
DOOR
BANGS
Harrington
Dude
we
need
you
man
That
douchebags
killing
us
Lets
go
All
right
Come
on
I
think
that
youre
bullshit
DARTAGNAN
CHITTERING
DUSTIN
His
name
is
dArtagnan
Cute
right
DArtagnan
Dart
for
short
And
he
was
in
your
trash
Foraging
for
food
You
wanna
hold
him
No
no
He
doesnt
bite
I
dont
want
to
Oh
God
hes
slimy
Ugh
hes
like
a
living
booger
Ugh
oh
God
What
is
he
My
question
exactly
At
first
I
thought
it
was
some
type
of
pollywog
Pollywog
Its
another
word
for
tadpole
A
tadpole
is
the
larval
stage
of
a
toad
I
know
what
a
tadpole
is
All
right
then
you
know
that
most
tadpoles
are
aquatic
right
Well
Dart
he
isnt
He
doesnt
need
water
Yeah
but
arent
there
nonaquatic
pollywogs
Terrestrial
pollywogs
Yep
Two
to
be
exact
Indirana
semipalmata
And
the
Adenomera
andreae
Ones
from
India
ones
from
South
America
So
how
did
one
end
up
in
my
trash
Maybe
some
scientists
brought
it
here
and
it
escaped
Do
you
guys
see
that
Looks
like
something
is
moving
inside
of
it
SCREECHES
BOTH
GASP
DUSTIN
Whoa
Its
okay
Its
okay
I
got
you
little
guy
CHITTERING
I
know
you
dont
like
that
Its
okay
And
theres
another
thing
Reptiles
theyre
coldblooded
Ectothermic
right
They
love
heat
the
sun
Dart
hates
it
It
hurts
him
So
if
hes
not
a
pollywog
or
a
reptile
Then
Ive
discovered
a
new
species
BELL
RINGS
We
gotta
show
him
to
Mr
Clarke
What
if
he
steals
my
discovery
Hes
not
gonna
steal
your
discovery
You
know
Im
thinking
about
calling
it
Dustonious
pollywogus
What
do
you
think
I
think
youre
an
idiot
When
I
become
rich
and
famous
for
this
one
day
dont
come
crawling
back
saying
Oh
my
God
Dustin
Im
so
sorry
for
being
mean
to
you
back
in
th
grade
Oh
my
God
Have
a
nice
day
Thank
you
Baloney
Mmm
Last
night
was
fun
Mmmhmm
Im
sorry
if
I
overstepped
anything
No
No
you
didnt
Okay
I
mean
I
I
like
you
so
much
Not
just
you
everything
that
comes
with
you
Your
family
your
boys
And
I
hope
its
not
wishful
thinking
but
I
kinda
feel
like
Im
breaking
through
with
them
Not
so
much
Jonathan
Hes
a
tough
cookie
to
crack
but
Yeah
With
Will
I
dont
know
I
feel
like
were
connecting
He
likes
you
too
Yeah
Mmmhmm
I
can
tell
Good
Oh
there
was
something
else
I
was
gonna
mention
but
Its
not
a
big
deal
at
all
but
I
just
noticed
this
morning
that
my
JVC
was
a
little
dinged
up
Your
what
The
video
camera
Oh
Yeah
It
still
works
fine
and
everything
I
just
I
went
back
and
watched
the
tape
and
there
were
some
older
kids
picking
on
Will
What
They
scared
him
Who
were
they
Were
they
the
Zimmerman
brothers
again
Um
I
dont
know
They
were
wearing
masks
or
sort
of
makeup
and
Maybe
They
were
the
right
age
Ill
kill
them
I
swear
to
God
I
will
I
will
kill
them
Thats
what
I
love
about
you
You
punch
back
CHUCKLES
I
was
never
really
one
to
put
up
a
fight
I
struggled
a
lot
like
Will
when
I
was
a
kid
With
bullies
SIGHS
Its
the
ones
like
us
that
dont
punch
back
that
people
really
take
advantage
of
you
know
They
rub
your
nose
in
it
just
a
little
bit
more
I
dont
know
why
they
do
that
Maybe
it
makes
them
feel
powerful
I
dont
know
But
hey
look
at
me
now
I
get
to
date
Joyce
Byers
Ha
CHUCKLES
Are
you
kidding
me
I
get
to
date
It
all
works
out
in
the
end
doesnt
it
Yes

HOPPER
Grass

trees
Everything
in
this
area
is
either
dead
or
dying
and
thats
a
radius
of
over
three
miles
And
it
all
leads
back
to
here
See
these
patterns
here
are
really
pretty
I
like
the
design
Its
almost
psychedelic
This
is
a
joke
to
you
huh
No
its
not
a
joke
I
just
I
dont
understand
what
this
has
to
do
with
me
Chief
Hopper
Whatever
is
happening
is
spreading
from
this
place
from
this
lab
Thats
impossible
Its

A

You

SCOFFS
All

Yeah
Yeah
he

upset
I

was
He
was
really
upset
But
he
was
still
worried
about
you
Hey
You
need
to
cut
yourself
some
slack
okay
People
say
stupid
things
when
theyre
wasted
Things
they
dont
mean
Yeah
but
thats
the
thing
What
if
I
did
mean
it
All
this
time
Ive
been
trying
so
hard
to
pretend
like
everythings
fine
but
its
not
I
I
feel
like
theres
this
I
dont
know
like
this
Like
theres
this
weight
youre
carrying
around
with
you
All
the
time
I
feel
it
too
Yeah
but
its
different
for
you
Will
came
home
Yeah
Yeah
he
did
But
hes
not
the
same
I
try
to
be
there
for
him
you
know
to
help
him
but
SIGHS
I
dont
know
I
mean
maybe
maybe
things
just
cant
go
back
to
the
way
they
were
Doesnt
that
make
you
mad
Mad
Yeah
that
those
those
people
who
did
this
who
ruined
so
many
lives
they
just
get
away
with
it
The
people
responsible
for
this
theyre
dead
Do

I
would
feel
so
sad
if
I

I
was
a
disappointment
to
her
because
she
didnt
live
very
long
after
that
you
see
She
died
of
a
fever
when
I
was
just
three
months
old
I
do
wish
shed
lived
long
enough
for
me
to
remember
calling
her
mother
I
think
it
would
be
so
sweet
to
say
mother
Do
I
have
a
mother
Yeah
of
course
you
have
a
mother
You
couldnt
really
be
born

She
Shes

Gone
Yeah
Im
sorry
about
that
kid
And
uh
father
died
four
days
afterwards
from
fever
too
That
left
me
an
orphan
and
folks
were
at
their
wits
end
so
Mrs
Thomas
said
to
me
what
to
do
with
me
You
see
nobody
wanted
me
even
then
It
seems
to
be
my
fate

Mike

Will

Lets
go
show
Mr
Clarke
What
What
Its
about
dArtagnan
This
is
the
reason
I
was
late
for
class
Pretty
neat
These
doors
function
Well
yeah
obviously
But
its
not
about
the
trap
Its
whats
inside
Now
this
very
well
may
change
your
perception
of
the
world
Consider
my
interest
piqued
All
right
first
lets
just
clarify
that
this
is
my
discovery
not
yours
Dustin
Jesus
Just
show
him
Im
just
trying
to
clarify
Dustin
Okay
fine
DOOR
OPENS
MIKE
Stop
Im
sorry
Mr
Clarke
It
was
just
a
stupid
prank
What
are
you
doing
I
told
him
to
stop
We
need
to
go
DUSTIN
Mike
Right
now
Right
now
So
your
sister
coming
or
what
Screw
it
That
little
shit
can
skate
home
And
dont
call
her
that
What
Sister
Shes
not
my
sister
ROCK
MUSIC
PLAYING
LOUDLY
BANGING
ON
DOOR
Hello
Hello
Guys
come
on
Can
I
come
in
yet
MIKE
No
I
dont
understand
What
do
you
not
understand
Will
saw
something
that
looked
like
Dart
last
year
Kind
of
but
there
was
no
tail
But
then
he
heard
it
yesterday
The
exact
same
sound
Why
didnt
you
tell
us
before
I
wasnt
sure
A
coincidence
MIKE
Or
not
What
if
when
Will
was
stuck
in
the
Upside
Down
he
somehow
acquired
True
Sight
True
Sight
It
gives
you
the
power
to
see
into
the
ethereal
plane
SIGHS
Elaborate
Maybe
these
episodes
that
Will
keeps
having
arent
really
flashbacks
at
all
Maybe
theyre
real
Maybe
Will
can
somehow
see
into
the
Upside
Down
So
that
would
mean
Dart
is
from
the
Upside
Down
SIGHS
We
have
to
take
him
to
Hopper
I
agree
No
way
If
we
take
him
to
Hopper
Darts
good
as
dead
Maybe
he
should
be
How
can
you
say
that
How
can
you
not
Hes
from
the
Upside
Down
Maybe
But
even
if
he
is
it
doesnt
automatically
mean
that
hes
bad
Thats
like
saying
just
because
someones
from
the
Death
Star
doesnt
make
them
bad
We
have
a
bond
A
bond
Just
because
he
likes
nougat
No
because
he
trusts
me
He
trusts
you
Yes
I
promised
I
would
take
care
of
him
DART

MIKE
Will
didnt

to
tell

but
on
Halloween
night
he
saw
a
sort
of
shadow
in
the
sky
A
shadow
STAMMERS
What
kind
of
shadow
I
dont
know
But
it
scared
him
And
if
Will
really
has
True
Sight
I
mean
if
he
can
really
see
into
the
Upside
Down
maybe
he
saw
that
shadow
again
yesterday
So
thats
why
he
was
frozen
like
that
Maybe
Can
it
hurt
him
I
mean
if
this
shadow
thing
isnt
from
our
world
Im
not
sure
Dustin
Well
if
youre
in
another
plane
you
cant
interact
with
the
material
plane
so
theoretically
no
the
shadow
cant
hurt
him
Yeah
if
thats
even
whats
happening
This
isnt
D
D
This
is
real
life
So
what
do
we

imagine
for
a
moment
if
a
foreign
state
lets
say
the
Soviets
If
they
heard
about
our
mistake
do
you
think
they
would
even
consider
that
a
mistake
What
if
they
tried
to
replicate
that
The
more
attention
we
bring
to
ourselves
the
more
the
more
people
like
the
Hollands
know
the
truth
the
more
likely
that
scenario
becomes
You
see
why
I
have
to
stop
the
truth
from
spreading
too
Just
same
as
those
weeds
there
By
whatever
means
necessary
SCREECHING

is
its

when
when
a

this
straight
You
kept
something
you

was
probably
dangerous
in
order
to
impress
a
girl
who
who
you
just
met
All
right
thats
grossly
oversimplifying
things
I
mean
why
would
a
girl
like
some
nasty
slug
anyway
An
interdimensional
slug
Because
its
awesome
Well
even
if
she
thought
it
was
cool
which
she
didnt
I
I
just
I
dont
know
I
just
feel
like
youre
trying
too
hard
Well
not
everyone
can
have
your
perfect
hair
all
right
Its
not
about
the
hair
man
The
key
with
girls
is
just
just
acting
like
you
dont
care
Even
if
you
do
Yeah
exactly
It
drives
them
nuts
Then
what
You
just
wait
until
uh
until
you
feel
it
Feel
what
Its
like
before
its
gonna
storm
you
know
You
cant
see
it
but
you
can
feel
it
like
this
uh
electricity
you
know
Oh
like
in
the
electromagnetic
field
when
the
clouds

the
atmosphere
No

Like

May

I

Im
hard

I
see
in
you
my
past
mistakes
They
were
kids
Does
that
excuse
that
mans
sins
Were
we
not
also
children
I
remember
the
day
I
came
to
the
rainbow
room
and
you
were
gone
So
when
my
gifts
were
strong
enough
I
used
them
to
escape
And
I
ran
I
ran
away
as
far
as
I
could
And
it
was
there
far
away
that
I
found
a
place
to
hide
A
family
A
home
Just
like
you
and
your
policeman
But
they
couldnt
help
me
So
eventually
I
lost
them
too
So
I
decided
to
play
the
part
To
stop
hiding
To
use
my
gifts
against
those
who
hurt
us
Youre
now
faced
with
the
same
choice
Jane
Go
back
into
hiding
and
hope
they
dont
find
you
Fight

you
havent
looked

Why
Because
you
thought
I
was
dead
Or
because
you
were
afraid
of
what
you
might
find
Go

You

to
confront
your

You
have
a

Demodogs
Its
like
a
compound
Its
like
a
play
on
words
Okay
I
mean
when
it
was
just
Dart
maybe
But
theres
an
army
now
DUSTIN
Precisely
His
army
What
do
you
mean
His
army
Maybe
if
we
stop
him
we
can
stop
his
army
too
DUSTIN
The
shadow
monster
It
got
Will
that
day
on
the
field
The
doctor
said
it
was
like
a
virus
it
infected
him
And
so
this
virus
its
connecting
him
to
the
tunnels
To
the
tunnels
monsters
the
Upside
Down
everything
Whoa
Slow
down
Slow
down
Okay
so
the
shadow
monsters
inside
everything
And
if
the
vines
feel
something
like
pain
then
so
does
Will
And
so
does
Dart
Yeah
Like
what
Mr
Clarke
taught
us
The
hive
mind
Hive
mind
A
collective
consciousness
Its
a
superorganism
And
this
is
the
thing
that
controls
everything
Its
the
brain
Like
the
mind
flayer
MAX
The
what
What
The
mind
flayer
What
the
hell
is
that
Its
a
monster
from
an
unknown
dimension
Its
so
ancient
that
it
doesnt
even
know
its
true
home
Okay
it
enslaves
races
of
other
dimensions
by
taking
over
their
brains
using
its
highlydeveloped
psionic
powers
Oh
my
God
none
of
this
is
real
This
is
a
kids
game
No
its
a
manual
And
its
not
for
kids
And
unless
you
know
something
that
we
dont
this
is
the
best
metaphor
Analogy
Analogy
Thats
what
youre
worried
about
Fine
An
analogy
for
understanding
whatever
the
hell
this
is
Okay
so
this
mind
flamer
thing
Flayer
Mind
flayer
SIGHS
What
does
it
want
To
conquer
us
basically
It
believes
its
the
master
race
STAMMERS
Like
the
Germans
Uh
the
Nazis
Yeah
yeah
yeah
the
Nazis
Uh
If
the
Nazis
were
from
another
dimension
totally
Uh
it
views
other
races
like
us
as
inferior
to
itself
It
wants
to
spread
take
over
other
dimensions
We
are
talking
about
the
destruction
of
our
world
as
we
know
it
Thats
great
Thats
great
Thats
really
great
Jesus
Okay
so
if
this
thing
is
like
a
brain
thats
controlling
everything
then
if
we
kill
it
We
kill
everything
it
controls
We
win
Theoretically
Great
So
how
do
you
kill
this
thing
Shoot
it
with
Fireballs
or
something
CHUCKLES
No
No
no
Fire
No
Fireballs
Uh
you
summon
an
undead
army
uh
because
STAMMERING
because
zombies
you
know
they
dont
have
brains
and
the
mind
flayer
it
it
It
likes
brains
Its
just
a
game
Its
a
game
What
the
hell
are
we
doing
here
I
thought
we
were
waiting
for
your
military
backup
We
are
How
are
they
gonna
stop
this
You
cant
just
shoot
this
with
guns
You
dont
know
that
We
dont
know
anything
We
know
its
already
killed
everybody
in
that
lab
We
know
the
monsters
are
gonna
molt
again
We
know
that
its
only
a
matter
of
time
before
those
tunnels
reach
this
town
JOYCE
Theyre
right
We
have
to
kill
it
I
want
to
kill
it
Me
too

Joyce

But
how
do
we
do
that
We
dont
exactly
know
what

dealing
with
here
MIKE
No
But
he
does
If
anyone
knows
how
to
destroy
this
thing
its
Will
Hes
connected
to
it
Hell
know
its
weakness
MAX
I
thought
we
couldnt
trust
him
anymore
That
hes
a
spy
for
the
mind
flayer
now
Yeah
but
he
cant
spy
if
he
doesnt
know
where

Listen
dude
a

calls

in
a

bottom
line
you
execute
it
All
right
Okay
first
of
all
this
isnt
some
stupid
sports
game
And
second
were
not
even
in
the
game
Were
on
the
bench
STAMMERS
So
my
point
is
Right
yeah
were
on
the
bench
so
uh
theres
nothing
we
can
do
Thats
not
entirely
true
I
mean
these
Demodogs
they
have
a
hive
mind
When
they
ran
away
from
the
bus
they
were
called
away
If
we
get
their
attention
Maybe
we
can
draw
them
from
the
lab
Clear
a
path
to
the
gate
Yeah
and
then
we
all
die
Thats
one
point
of
view
No
thats
not
a
point
of
view
man
Thats
a
fact
I
got
it
This
is
where
the
chief
dug
his
hole
This
is
our
way
into
the
tunnel
So
Here
right
here
This
is
like
a
hub
So
you
got
all
the
tunnels
feeding
in
here
Maybe
if
we
set
this
on
fire
Oh
yeah
Thats
a
no
The
mind
flayer
would
call
away
his
army
Theyd
all
come
to
stop
us
We
circle
back
to
the
exit
Guys
By
the
time
they
realize

El
